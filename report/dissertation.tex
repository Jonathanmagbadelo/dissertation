% SUMMARY HERE (300 word limit for most subjects):
Word embedding algorithms such as GloVe are vector space models capable of providing a distributed representation of words. By utilising vast amounts of text corpora, these representations are able to encapsulate semantic and syntactic regularities along with relationships between words. Traditional word embedding algorithms tend to operate on corpus documents in solidarity, often neglecting additional covariate metadata attached to corpus documents. 

\noindent
\newline
CoVeR, an extension of the GloVe algorithm, jointly learns word embeddings together with a set of diagonal weight matrices, representing the affect of a particular covariate on the base embeddings.

\noindent
\newline
This project explores the use of covariate specific word embeddings for both neural language modelling and text classification. Specifically, both models are applied to a possible use case: a songwriting assistant application. The main areas covered in this dissertation are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An overview of issues songwriters face whilst writing songs.
	\item An overview of related research 
	\item An introduction to word embeddings, neural language modelling and text classification.
	\item Requirements analysis for SONGIFAI, the prototype application.
	\item A detailed account of the implementation process.
	\item An evaluation of CoVeR and its usage in each model.
	\item An evaluation of SONGIFAI
	\item Limitations and future work
	
\end{itemize}
