\section{Overview}
Songwriting is a form of composition through which songs are created, often drawing from personal experiences. The most important aspects of songwriting are structure and content, with the latter being a key influence on the listeners ability to relate to a song. The main issue songwriters face is word choice through which they can express their ideas concisely and create clear contexts for the listener. The choice of words will either enhance or hinder the ability of the lyrics to effectively impact a listener.
