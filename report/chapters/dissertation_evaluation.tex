\subsection{Validating Implementation}
\subsubsection{Base Embeddings}
As stated earlier, no publicly available version of the CoVeR algorithm exists. Being an extension of the Glove algorithm which still learns base word embeddings for focal and context vectors, comparing the outputs of both base embeddings served as a good metric. To measure the similarity between the two base embeddings generated by Glove and Cover, the F1 scores where generated to compare the 
\subsubsection{Covariate Specific Embeddings}
The original CoVeR paper validates the quality of the learned covariate weight matrices by clustering. This was done
