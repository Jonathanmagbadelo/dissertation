"You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart. Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out. How to love. How to love. You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever. Now you in the corner tryna put it together. How to love. How to love. When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious. But now your grown up. So fly its like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds. Without you being insecure. You never credit yourself so when you got older.

Now you in the corner tryna put it together. How to love. How to love. For a second you were here. Why you over there?. Its hard not to stare the way you move thinking. Like you never had a love. Had a love. You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions. The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions. But it wasn't your fault. Wasn't in your intentions. You the one here talking to me. You don't wanna listen. But i admire your poppin bottles and grinning. Just as much as you admire the begining'. So don't be mad. Nobody else trippin. You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook. See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart. Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out. How to love. How to love.

The blank pages. Of my diary. That I haven't touched. Since you left me. The closed blinds. In my home. See no light of day. Dust gathers. On my stereo. Cos I can't bare. To hear the radio. The piano sits. In a shaded space. With a picture. Of your face. I'm scared. To face another day. Cos the fear in me. Just won't go away. In an instant. You were gone. And I'm scared. Coffee stains. On your favorite book. Remind me of you. So I can't even look. The magazines. You left on the floor. You won't need. Them anymore. A towel left. Hangin on the wall. No sign of wet foosteps. In the hall. There's no smell. Of your sweet cologne. I'm lying here alone. I'm scared. To face another day. Cos the fear in me. Just won't go away. In an instant. You were gone. And now I'm scared. I'm scared. To face another day. Cos the fear in me. Just won't go away. In an instant. You were gone. Now I'm scared. In an instant. You were gone. And I'm scared,Pop,Britney Spears

We’ll never change. But I have. You and her in the local newspaper. You will be married and you’ll be gone. Married and you’ll be gone.",Pop,Belle & Sebastian

"Thin hung the web like a trap in a cage. The fox lay asleep in his lair. Fangs frantic paws told the tale of his sin. Far off the chase shrieked revenge. Outcast he trespassed where no wolf may tread. The last sacred haunt of the dead. He learnt of a truth which only one wolf may know. The sceptre and crown of the king. Howling for blood, One-eye leads on the pack. Plunging through forests and snow-storms. Steep rose the ridge, ghostly peaks climbed the sky. Fang sped through jungles of ice. Hard on his rail, One-eye drew from the pack. An old hero conquered by none. Steep, far too steep, grew the pathway ahead. Descent was the only escape. A wolf never flees in the face of his foe. Fang knew the price he would pay. One-eye stood before him. With the crown upon his head. Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow. Fang, Son of Great Fang, the Traitor we seek. The laws of the Brethren say this:. That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods. And he, the Ursurper must die -. Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe. But Fang fought the hero in vain. Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red. Never would the Crown leave again. One-eye hid the Crown and with laurels on his head. Returned amongst the tribe and dwelt in peace.",Pop,Genesis
"For all I've been blessed with in this life,. There was an emptyness in me,. I was imprisoned by the power of gold,. With one honest touch you set me free.. Chorus. Let the world stop turning,. Let the sun stop burning,. Let them tell you love's not worth going through,. If it all falls apart,. I will know deep in my heart,. The only dream that mattered had come true,. In this life, I was loved by you. For every mountain I have climbed,. And every raging river crossed,. You were the treasure longed to find,. Without your love I would be lost.. Let the world stop turning,. Let the sun stop burning,. Let them tell you love's not worth going through,. If it all falls apart,. I will know deep in my heart,. The only dream that mattered had come true,. In this life, I was loved by you.. In this life I was loved by you.. post by Lino Gonçalves PT",Pop,Westlife
I can pacify your violence. I can guarantee no pain. Feel the ugly force of motion. Deep inside your guilty brain. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Pulpit of the Python. Chasing out the innocents defiled. Leave your weapon in the cool stream. Rest your body on the stone. Multitude will beckon to a clear sky. Rise again to follow all who came. Are you really evil?. I saw you in the Devil’s Kitchen. Cooking for the Queen of Spades. Hiding in your pretty laces. Licking fingers sunk in jam. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Pulpit of the Python. Chasing out the innocents defiled. Curl your flimsy leaves around me. Sorceress you cannot still command. Burning in the orifice of Hades. Sacrifice your magic to my hand. Are you really evil?. I saw you in the Hermit's garden. Picking fruit to fill his flesh. Tacking spells to take his body. Trapping him inside your mesh. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Going out to get you. Pulpit of the Python. Chasing out the innocents defiled,Pop,Genesis
"Seven weeks until the summer,. My nights are long and sober,. Everybody's going out and I'm left all alone.. Is something wrong? Am I contagious?. Working for minimum wages,. Been flipping burgers now for ages. While my friends are home.. Hello, can I take your order please?. Yes, I'm a loser.. Seven weeks of fries with extra cheese,. Then I'm all done.. It won't be long,. Sunglasses on. It feels so wrong, when summer's gone.. We'll sing this song. Dance all night long.. . - Gabriela;",Pop,McFly
"I was young but I wasn't naive. I watched, helpless. As she turned around to leave. And still I have the pain I have to carry. A past so deep that even you could not bury. if you tried. After all this time. I never thought we'd be here. Never thought we'd be here. When my love for you was blind. But I couldn't make you see it. Couldn't make you see it. That I loved you more than you'll ever know. A part of me died when I let you go. I would fall asleep. Only in hopes of dreaming. That everything would be like it was before. But nights like this it seems are slowly fleeting. They disappear as reality is crashing to the floor. After all this time. I never thought we'd be here. Never thought we'd be here. When my love for you was blind. But I couldn't make you see it. Couldn't make you see it. That I loved you more than you'll ever know. A part of me died when I let you go. After all this while. Would you ever wanna leave it. Maybe you could not believe it. That my love for you was blind. But I couldn't make you see it. Couldn't make you see it. That I loved you more than you will ever know. A part of me died when I let you go. And I loved you more than you'll ever know. A part of me died when I let you go",Pop,Lifehouse

"5 o`clock a.m. my head is aching. My eyes are red my throat is hoarse and dry. Nothing can get lost, I work with logic. But something makes me feel unsatisfied. Passin´ through my dark and unmade bedroom. Another restless night is over now. I got so much more in mind that I won`t recall. I try to keep it but I don´t know how. My thoughts are gliding far away into the distance. Diving deep into my soul where my emotions run and flow. Recallin´ fluent dreams to hold on to a vision. Thinking castles in the air, mental pictures everywhere. But they will liquefy…. Chorus. Who`s savin´ me, before it`s gone. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn. Who`s savin` me, my soul unsaid. Imaginations and impressions floating slowly. Who`s savin` me, before it´s gone. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn. Who`s savin` me, my soul unsaid. Imaginations and impressions floating slowly out of my head. 3 o`clock p.m. and I`m still tired. Someone`s ringin` forcibly my bell. Feeling so narcotic , feelin´ so forlorn. Evacuated like an empty shell. My thoughts are gliding far away into the distance. Diving deep into my soul where my emotions run and flow. Recallin´ fluent dreams to hold on to a vision. Thinking castles in the air, mental pictures everywhere. Chorus(2x). Who`s savin´ me, before it`s gone. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn. Who`s savin` me, my soul unsaid. Imaginations and impressions floating slowly. Who`s savin` me, before it´s gone. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn. Who`s savin` me, my soul unsaid. Imaginations and impressions floating slowly out of my head. Out of my head. Who`s savin´ me, before it`s gone. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn. Who`s savin` me, my soul unsaid. Imaginations and impressions floating slowly. Who`s savin` me. I loose a bootleg version of my thoughts till dawn. Who`s savin` me. Imaginations and impressions floating slowly out of my head",Pop,Patrick Nuo

Fumbling down a road lined with signs. It's obvious I'm in the wrong direction. And I won't stop now you know I feel fine. Just looking for some affection. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. I figure it won't be long it won't be hard. I've just got to get my feet back on the ground. Just got a hold of some unlucky cards. And I have yet to make another round. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water. No one lent a hand. No one laid a look upon me. Invisible to everything but blame. No one dared to believe in anything. And left me to drown in this place. All I ask is to be able to hold on longer. And all I ask is to be able to walk on water. Walk on water.,Pop,Vanessa Carlton
"(1st Verse). It's been a struggle for me,. Wonderin` why I can't get by with my life,. But now I'm free,. And I done did some right and wrong,. But still I see the light,. And I done been around the sex and drugs,. Hustlin` but mama ain't raise no thug,. And it took a little to see how real it could get,. And how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I,. Seen a lot of bad things on my block,. But I ain't wonna be a victim of a gunshot,. I can't let nothing? hold me down. (Chorus). See all the things I read about,. Aee all the things I've heard about,. I seen the light. (2nd Verse). It's kinda hard for me,. To stay away from all these girls. And the haters they don't like,. That I'm fulfillin` my dream,. But I'm just tryna do my thing,. My nigga can't I live my life,. I got the world on my shoulders (shoulders),. And I'm only getting` older (older),. But it's like it's getting` colder,. I'm gone make it but I can't take it sometimes,. I came a long way from my block,. And I'm grateful for everything I got,. I didn't let nothing bring me down. (Chorus). Aw man, after all this, who would`ve thought,. Little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia,. You know what I`m sayin`,. would make it all the way to the top.. (Rap). Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit,. They try to show us the light but we don't like to. hear it,. Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics,. A large heard across my sight I had to fight to clear it,. Like a runner a couple of summers I often wondered if it really was winter. And that's when I heard the thunder,. A current was occurin` it was stirrin` up my hunger,. But I couldn't let the shit bury a nigga under,. Use to cry hopin` all of this would pass,. And then I learned to use my tears to water up the. grass,. A part of my swagga but apparently I won,. I took my shades off and now I'm starin` at the sun,. I'm seein` the light, I'm seein the light,. realizing` that it's me in the light,. I read about it (read about it),. Heard about it (heard about it) now I know. I coulda did wrong,. I seen a lot of people hustle,. But I left them things alone,. I almost lost my friend to the struggle,. But I guess that made me strong,. made me strong,. I seen a whole lot of drama,. And it taught me how to fight,. Taught me how to fight,. And I thank God for my mama,. She showed me what was right,. I coulda been in the dark,. But thank God for the light,. (I see the light) I see the light. (End adlibs). All the things I heard about,. I read about it, I read about it, oh,. I see the light, I see the light",Pop,Chris Brown

"I don't think that passenger seat. Has ever looked this good to me. He tells me about his night. I count the colors in his eyes. He'll never fall in love. He swears, as he runs his fingers through his hair. I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong. And I don't think it ever crossed his mind. He tells a joke, I fake a smile. But I know all his favorite songs. And I could tell you. His favorite color's green. He loves to argue. Born on the seventeenth. His sister's beautiful. He has his father's eyes. And if you ask me if I love him... I'd lie. He looks around the room. Innocently overlooks the truth. Shouldn't a light go on. Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long. He sees everything in black and white. Never let nobody see him cry. I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine. I could tell you. His favorite color's green. He loves to argue. Born on the seventeenth. His sister's beautiful. He has his father's eyes. And if you ask me if I love him... I'd lie. He stands there, then walks away. My god, if I could only say. I'm holding every breath for you. He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar. I think he can see through everything. But my heart. First thought when I wake up is. My god, he's beautiful. So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle. Yes I could tell you. His favorite color's green. He loves to argue. Oh, and it kills me. His sister's beautiful. He has his father's eyes. And if you ask me if I love him... If you ask me if I love him... I'd lie",Pop,Taylor Swift
"*Note: This is taken from 5iveweb, I'm not sure the lyrics are 100% true. I'll try to get the real ones soon, cos there's this missing part here too!*. Yo, I've got a little story that I'd like to address. To individuals, gotta get it off my chest. It ain't about who's the best. Or Five being better than the next. We're just a little different from the rest. Cos see, we got each other. When things go down. And time is just too important to be messin around. So understand not what i'm trying to say. But appreciate living life day to day. So how does it feel to be the only ones. Left out in the rain cos you're phoney ones. Wake up and realise what you live is a dream. Ain't gonna be there for long even though it may seem. Like a never ending story. You in it for the money or the glory. Open up your ears or ignore me. All I'm tryin' to do is be the man I am and be the best in this world I can. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. You got to open your mind up and kick both your feet up. I'll hit you with a tale of how the five of us were meet up. We're just five guys who wanna rise to the skies. No ......... we got a vision in our eyes. Now people wanna step up and try to hold us back. They wanna try to stop us getting freaky on this track. But this is how we kick it and this is how we swing. And this is how I hit you with the funk that I bring. Now you gotta select to connect not disrespect. And you gotta learn to keep your negativity in check. Cos everybody knows what goes around comes around. I'll put it down with my sound. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share. If you feel it throw your hands up in the air. Time is running out, memories die. Keep movin on. Gotta keep movin on. Reminiscing bout the time we used to share.

"They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul. A voyager and a settler, they both have a distant goal. If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside. Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself. I've always tried. Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion. Move on. Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing. Move on. Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning. Move on. How I treasure every minute. Being part of it, being in it. With the urge to move on. I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind. It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time. And somewhere lies the answer. To all the questions why. What really makes the difference. Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive. Like a roller in the ocean. Life is motion. Move on. Like a wind that's always blowing. Life is flowing. Move on. Like the sunrise in the morning. Life is dawning. Move on. How I treasure every minute. Being part of it. Being in it. With the urge to move on. The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea. The crying of the seagulls that hover over me. I see it and I hear it. But how can I explain. The wonder of the moment. To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain. Like a roller in the ocean. Life is motion. Move on. Like a wind that's always blowing. Life is flowing. Move on.

Tonight when the darkness comes. Why don't we treat it like a friend. Then we'll both be glad to see the night. And we'll be hoping. It's never going to end. So don't be afraid of what the night-time may bring. You must understand that you can dream of anything. Chorus:. So fall into sleep. Peaceful and deep. And may this journey help you fly. When you can't hold out much longer. Don't you cry. When the darkness is getting stronger. Sleep like a child. Peaceful and deep. And when you lay you down. I pray your soul to keep. Sleep like a child. Peaceful and deep. And when you lay you down. I pray your soul to keep. You won't be alone. For I will not be denied. Under the darkest of skies. I'm gunna be by your side. Chorus. Well I know. I can see it in your eyes. You're tired of fighting everyday. Trying to struggle through the night. Yes I know that it's hard to carry on. So just lay down your head. And in your dreams you will be strong. Sleep like a child. Peaceful and deep. And when you lay you down. I pray your soul to keep. Oh like a child. Peaceful and deep. Sleep like a child. Peaceful and deep. And when you lay you down. I pray your soul to keep. . Por: Otavio Moreira,Pop,Joss Stone

Most of the time I let the seasons change. And listen only, only, only to the songs. that are sung by the city. I'm gonna change, everything will change. all for the better. The travelling sounds. from a million years will bring us together. I'm gonna change, everything will change - all for the better.

Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon. Oh, won't you stay. We'll put on the day. There's a sun show every second. Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today. And the streets are paved with passersby. And pigeons fly. And papers lie. Waiting to blow away. Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew. There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too. And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses. Oh, won't you stay. We'll put on the day. And we'll talk in present tenses. When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away. I will bring you incense owls by night. By candlelight. By jewel-light. If only you will stay. Pretty baby, won't you. Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning.",Pop,Joni Mitchell
"The first breath. A new sky. You hung the stars. And placed the sunrise. Painted colors. Yellow and green. And every other in between. From the dust. Became flesh and bone.

I'm so glad I'm alive. Bare feet. My first steps. And new dreams. In every sunset. What a gift. That You give me every day. But what a price You had to pay. I'm alive. I'm alive. I feel Your arms around me. Your eyes of love surround me. I'm alive. To shine in pure perfection. And wake up every morning in Your light. I'm so glad I'm alive. Life traveling on. And when my time has come. To say farewell. From dust to dust. But You bring me safely home. I take my first breath. I see the new sky. I hear the angels. I see my Father's eyes. And I know, oh, I know. I'm alive. I'm alive. I feel Your arms around me. Your eyes of love surround me. I'm alive. To shine in pure perfection.

We were once so strong. Our love is like a song. You can't forget it at all. And at last. All the pictures have been burned. And all the past. Is just a lesson that we've learned. I won't forget it. Please don't forget... us. Somewhere we went wrong. Our love is like a song. But you won't sing along. You've forgotten... about... us,Pop,Christina Grimmie

"You got a busted heart, you got a broken dream. Somebody tore it all and departed on a rainy day. They didn't leave no note, they didn't leave no trace.

You got a brand new start, you got a real good heart. You gotta smile, just give it a while, it's gonna be okay. You're not the only one looking 'round lookin' for someone. You gotta trust love, love is on the way. You could've never known, how the dice are gonna roll. Still you got a little mo', a little fight. You gotta dance with the truth, while you slowly lose. You gotta wipe those lonely teardrops from your eyes. So don't you give up, love is gonna find you. You can feel it in your gut, it's there to remind you. Nothing good comes without a little pain.

See my feet on the ground. It feels like the worlds gravity drowned. When I'm with you I'm high. Instead of hiding my face. My minds in your eyes. Can your love embrace. Me as I am. In the silence you stare at the world. Your eyes are screaming to be heard. I wanna learn you inside out. When time isn't on our side. All we have now. For the rest of our lives. Let's stay up all night. In the silence you stare the at world. Your eyes are screaming to be heard. I wanna learn you inside out. All that changes is time. Can't keep you inside of me. You're out of my mind. I wear you on my sleeve. In the silence you stare at the world. your eyes are screaming to be heard. I want to learn you inside out. I see all that you want to be. Look into your soul. Looking right back at me. I want to learn you inside out,Pop,Lifehouse
"IæŠ³e waited all this time,. Counted minutes as theyæŠ³e passed:. Searching for a sign,. Wishing for the best.. And just my hopes were wearing thin,. You turned my heart to Love again.. Like a miracle, out of the blue,. You rescued me like the angels do.. You shook the heavens, and cracked the sky,. When you walked, when you walked into my life.. When you appear,. Like sight to the blind,. Like music to my ears,. Like reason to arrive.. And just when I thought my chance was gone,. Love came to me, with open arms.. Like a miracle, out of the blue,. You rescued me like the angels do.. You shook the heavens and cracked the sky,. When you walked, when you walked into my life.. You spoke my name,. And the world begun again.. You touched my heart,. And it opened.. Like a miracle, out of the blue,. You rescued me like the angels do.. You shook the heavens and cracked the sky,. When you walked, when you walked into my life.. åŒ¶ou rescued me. åŒ¶ou shook the heavens and cracked the sky,.",Pop,Jaci Velasquez

Well I'm looking for an angel. Someone to watch over me. Someone to lean on my shoulder. I wanna feel how love can be. But these things they don't come easy. I've learned my lesson well. Some things don't work the way you planned. Sometimes you just can't tell. So I'm looking for an angel. Someone to let you know my love for you. Seems I've never felt this way before. I never wanted to see just what love can do. But these things they don't come easy. I've learned my lesson well. When things don't work the way you planned. You need someone to tell. You are my paradise. The source of my desires. I believe in you so much. I'm longing for your touch. I need you by my side. So all my dreams will fly. I can't live this way because I know. I cry alone. I fear to cry alone alone. So what will I do without you. Who will I see when I close my eyes. I can't face another night alone without you here. Cause I can't face the night. Without you here. Alone without you here. Sometimes you just can't tell. You are my paradise. The source of my desires I believe in you so much. I'm waiting. Here for your touch. I need you by my side so with my dreams I can touch the sky. I can't live this way cause this time I know. I cry alone. I fear to cry here alone.

Take a look around. And see the world we think we know. Then look closer. There's more to life than meets the eye. A beauty to behold. It's all much bigger than we know. It's only just beginning to unfold. So let it all unfold. Far beyond all reason in your mind. There's a world mysterious. There for you to find. All these questions. That we always have. All we are is curious. There's nothing wrong with that. So go 'round every corner. Search every part of the sky. 'Cause a life that's full of wonder. Is a wonderful life. Dig beneath the surface. Find the lessons there to learn. And then dig deeper. Feed your intuition. Don't leave ant stone unturned. Be the seeker of the truth. Listen when you hear it calling you. You know it's calling you. Far beyond all reason in your mind. There's a world mysterious. There for you to find. All these questions that we always have. All we are is curious. There's nothing wrong with that. So go 'round every corner. Search every part of the sky. 'Cause a life that's full of wonder. Is a wonderful life. Is a wonderful life. Is a wonderful life. Is a wonderful life.

"Within the best car my dear. My lips torture him right?. Look at my, look at me. I'm the kind of boy you will ever have. Do not feel, just feel me. Do not imagine me, I'm too much for you. Kisses without feeling, crossed eyes. Jewelry in my car, use many diamond jewelry. Citing the nation's rules. Guided by divide order. Lot, jewelry and diamonds.

Stars gleaming. Kids are dreaming. Of what the day will bring. In the fallen snow under the mistletoe. I need you here with me when I hold you close. Baby, take my hand in wonderland. Cause its Merry Christmas time again. Its Christmas time again. A wreath on every front door. Lights hung for all to see. Warm cider by the fire. Stockings for you and me. Kids a gift for Santa. Milk and cookies by the tree. I'm wondering what will he bring. This year on Christmas Eve. In the fallen snow under the mistletoe. I need you here with me when I hold you close.

"Hello Good Evening And Welcome. I've been down the high road towards the crossroads. To hear the sound thats buggin me.. Catchy little rhythms in music and rhyme, its that nutty sound you see.. Rhythm..... As I got nearer I heard it clearer , it started to affect my brain. Its that nutty rhythm that gets yout thinking your almost going insane.. I felt the greound shake,. I had a feeling I was sitting on an old steam train. Shaking in me knee bones and me elbows, its driving me around the bend. Uncontrollable feelings sends me reeling,. Theres no need top pretend. Melody.... It had me spell bound, span me head round,. I could feel myself going mad.. Now I am an addict,. I have to hear it,. Everything else sounds bad......",Pop,Madness
"You're sure to make a fool of me, I see now. It really wasn't that too hard to leave, don't reach out. Maybe next time I can put up a fight and win. Maybe next time, maybe next time. I can't control myself, tell me right now if I'm going mad. Might need a little help, lost everything that I have had. Always been running and never been sure. Live for tomorrow or staying afraid. If I can get you back at all then maybe I can really change. I can't redeem myself, the moment I try, the moment I fail. I pick my battles well, pointing the finger. 'cause nothing's for sale. Love don't come easy and nothing is free. Trust is an issue, it's all about me. It's easy for you to go pickup and leave. and when you do, I'll be free. You're sure to make a fool of me, I see now. It really wasn't that too hard to leave, don't reach out. Maybe next time I can put up a fight and win. Maybe next time, maybe next time. I'm going out tonight, drinking myself into a hole. It won't make shit right but at least I can let you go. For one minute long or the length of a song. I won't give in even if I'm wrong. All the best I can wish for has put me down, left me confused. All the best I can ask for is another chance for me to lose. Whatever's left for us to gain and so and so. Etcetera, no letting up or placing blame. You're sure to make a fool of me, I see now. It really wasn't that too hard to leave, don't reach out. Maybe next time I can put up a fight and win. Maybe next time, maybe next time.

"Where Lagan stream sing lullaby. There blows a lily fair. When twilight gleam is in her eyes. The night is on her hair. And like a love - sick lenanshee. She hath my heart in thrall. No life have I, no liberty. With love is lord of all. And sometimes when the beetles horn. Hath lulled the eve to sleep. I steal unto her shieling low. And through her dooreen peep. There on the cricket's singing stone. She stirs the bog wood fire. And hums in soft sweet undertones. The song of heart's desire. Her welcome like her love for me. Is from her heart within. Her warm kiss is felicity. That knows no taint of sin",Pop,The Corrs

Not even the Gods above. Can separate the two of us. No, nothing can come between. You and I. Oh, you and I. I figured it out. Saw the mistakes of up and down. Meet in the middle.

I trembled in your presence. I was lost the very minute. That you came my way. There was no escape. I pictured us together. But you told me you weren't ready. Said it's much too soon. That's a year ago. You asked me to be patient. So I told myself that I could wait. And time went by. Somehow it's different now. So if you start to make regrets. It's a little late. All that you've been wishing for. Was right in your hands. But you covered your eyes. When you could have seen through its disguise. You didn't realize. All that you've been wishing for. Was not out of reach. You discovered as I walked away. You complained. But it won't bring me back. Can't you see that. It's a little late. . Everything's the opposite. of what it used to be. I guess and now you know. what I was going through. You are counting days apart. But can't find one way to win back. My heart but babe. What is it they say. Good things come to those who wait. Not if you only hesitate. Like you in doubt. So your time ran out. . So if you start to make regrets. It's a little late. All that you've been wishing for. Was right in your hands. But you covered your eyes. When you could have seen through its disguise. You didn't realize. All that you've been wishing for. Was not out of reach. You discovered as I walked away. You complained. But it won't bring me back. Can't you see that. It's a little late. It's a little late. You had it all. It was right in your hands. Maybe you by now start to regret mistakes.

But on that road I took a fall. Oh baby why did you run away?. I was there for you. In your darkest times. I was there for you. In your darkest nights. But I wonder where were you.

Fly away. From a broken heart. You have your love I've got to know. What you say to me?. Why'd you throw it all away?. Where you go to I don't know. As tears of angels.

And I care if you forget about me. And I cry. And I cry. 'Til you take it all from my heart. Fly away. Upon the wings of love. Though I'll be here again tomorrow. Like an angel. Falling softly upon her knees. Calling to me. Hear her gently sighing pleas. I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back. I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack. And I care if you forget about me. But I cry. And I cry. 'Til you take it all from my heart. I'm a fool if I think my babe'll come back. I'll be waiting still I'm starting to crack.

"To every day there's a history. To every love that's lost there is tragedy. I saved a vision of you in my head. Watched a new universe being born, raised and bred. In the calm of my bed. Some might say it's over now. I don't believe them. If I only got to you. I'd prove I'm right. Only when I dream. I hear you, I'm near you. I hold you close to me. Only when I dream. I touch you and I breathe you. I feel you deep inside me. Things were never easy for me. In the temple we built to stay sacred and free. I came lookin' for more self esteem. All I found was your voice. On the answering machine. Simple and clean. Some might say it's too far gone. I don't believe them. If I could only talk to you. I'd prove I'm right. Only when I dream.... I tried to catch a butterfly. I tried to make God's summer sky. Heal me. Rain exploding in my face. Seems to fade without a trace. Heal me",Pop,Roxette

And rip him out of history. Chorus:. People marching to the drums. Every bodies having fun. To the sound of love. Ugly is the world we're on. If I'm right then prove me wrong.

"Said you're ""all mouth and no brains"". All rock stars go to heaven. You said you'll be dead at 27. When we drunk in a english tavern. The owner poured you the Bourbon. And you drunk yourself so rotten. He got so rich he bought a Bentley. And moved himself to Devon. You started dirty dancing. And you bar tended a dozen. I took you to the clinic. To get you clean but you couldn't. Said in two days you're 27. And your destiny was coming. So your papa passed so sudden. And left you with lil' somin'. You blew that money on a mountain of drugs. And staged yourself a bed in. A month later when I popped in. You're still high but the winter set in. I bought you a coffee and a muffin. And you quoted me some Lenin. I wished I was that clever. But that's what kept me coming. Your friendship did mean somin'. But you left me for nothing. When I left, you befriended a rope. And I saw you both were hanging",Pop,M.I.A.

And all of my friends. Had been disaffected. Now I'm searching for trust. In a city of rust. A city of vampires. Tonight Elvis is dead. And everyone's spread. And love is a satire. And now I know my heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. My heart is a ghost town. There's no one left in the world. I'm gunslingin'. Don't give a fuck if I go. Down down down.

No, I don't wanna lie down. Just when I think. That love will get me through this. I run away. It's a little too perfect. I get tired. of saying things like. ""I love you, babe"". When I'm confined. I'll find a way out there. I get high. ‘Cause I suffocate down there. If you're right. And this life is really just a game.... I wanna win it. Let me win it. Let me in it this time. I wanna win it. Let me win it. Let me in it this time. Whoa, oh. I'm sick of looking doubt in my face. Wish that I could shout down doubt. Put it in its place. Wish that I could change my fade. And erase. All the praying that I did. to be great. Hoping I would never see the day. But I was born to be great. But only on my own. So forgive me if I let it ring. When you call me up on the telephone.

"I know that there`s a reason why I need to be alone. I need to find a silent place that I can call my own. Is it mine, oh Lord is it mine ?. You know I get so weary from the battles in this life. and many times it seems that you`re the only hope in sight. Is it mine, oh Lord is it mine ?. When everything`s dark and nothing seems right. there`s nothing to win and there`s no need to fight.. I never cease to wonder at the cruelty of this land. but it seems a time of sadness is a time to understand. Is it mine, oh Lord is it mine ?. When everything`s dark and nothing seems right. You don`t have to win and there`s no need to fight. If only I could find a way. to feel your sweetness through the day. The love that shines around me could be mine. So give us an answer won`t you.

Let me tell you a secret. Put it in your heart and keep it. There's something that I want you to know. Do something for me. Listen to my simple story. And maybe we'll have someting to show. You tell me you're cold on the inside. How can the outside world. Be a place that your heart can embrace. Be good to yourself. Because nobody else. Has the power to make you happy. How can I help you?. Please let me try to. I can heal the pain. That you're feeling inside. Whenever you want me. You know that I will be. Waiting for the day. That you say you'll be mine. He must have really hurt you. To make you say the things that you do. He must have really hurt you. To make those pretty eyes look so blue. He must have known. That he could. That you'd never leave him. Now you can't see my love is good. And that I'm not him. How can I help you?. Please let me try to. I can heal the pain. Won't you let me inside. Whenever you want me.

Show me the heart right now. Who needs a lover. That can't be a friend. Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for. If you ever should see him again. Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more. Someone who will protect you. Love and respect you. All those things. That he never could bring to you. Like I do. Or rather I would. Won't you show me your heart. Like you should. How can I help you?. Please let me try to. I can heal the pain. Won't you let me inside. Whenever you want me. You know that I will be.

I have no friends, no-one to see. And I am never invited. Now I am here, talking to you. No wonder I get excited. Your smile, and the sound of your voice. And the way you see through me.

I lit a match then let it catch, to light up the room. and then you yelled as we beyelled an old maroon hot air balloon. [Chorus]. I'll be out of my mind, and you'll be out of ideas. pretty soon. so let`s spend, the afternoon in a cold hot air. balloon. leave your jacket behind, lean out and touch the. treetops over town. I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down. [Verse 2]. We drank the great lakes, like cold lemonade. And both got stomach aches, sprawled out in the shade. so bored to death you held your breath, and I tried not to yawn. you made my frown turn upside down, and now my worries are gone. [Chorus].

"The fortune queen of New Orleans. Was brushing her cat in her black limousine. On the back seat were scratches. From the marks of men her fortune she had won. Couldn't see through the tinted glass. She said, ""Home James"" and he hit the gas. I followed her to some darkened room. She took my money, she said, ""I'll be with you soon"". CHORUS:. Dark lady laughed and danced. And lit the candles one by one. Danced to her gypsy music. Till her brew was done. Dark lady played black magic. Till the clock struck on the twelve. She told me more about me. Than I knew myself. She dealt two cards, a queen and a three. And mumbled some words. That were so strange to me. Then she turned up a two-eyed jack. My eyes saw red but the card. Still stayed black. She said the man you love is secretly true. To someone else who is very close to you. My advice is that you leave this place. Never come back and forget you ever saw my face. Chorus. So I ran home and crawled in my bed. I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said. Then I remembered her strange perfume. And how I smelled it once in my own room. So I sneaked back and caught her with my man. Laughing and kissing till they saw the gun in my hand. The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor. Dark lady would never turn a card up anymore. Chorus.",Pop,Cher

I'll stick my lighting rod between your thunder thighs.. [Shanell]. Where do we run to hid, share our feelings as we keep it inside.. Where do the kids go to play after the midnight is slipping away?. I know a place where we can go.. Just you and me would have to know.. Welcome to the other side.. Judges sleeping into the night.

We disagree on the pain and the practice.. One day I guarantee youre a goner.. We do the things we want when we wanna.. I like for love to move through my chest and I like the beat to do the same thing.. My suit and my fedora, my passion.. My DNA is me I cant change.. [Shanell]. Check your inhabitations at the door..

"If I build it out of blood and bone. If I love it and I even give it a good name. And I let it stand up on it's own. And if I even ever learn to trust and to walk away. Will it crumble on it's own two feet?. Or will it multiply and grow big white wings?. If I love it and I give it life. Can I let it go and know that it was never mine?. Give more, give it all away. I'm sure it'll come back someday. You gotta let go to let it circle back around. To rise up you gotta learn to root down. If I cut it with a heart-shaped knife. And I send it to my very closest of friends. And they somehow bring it back to life. What if I only ever do it all over again?. I'm a writer here upon this ship. On a sea of unnamed and untamed passages. And every vessel's meant for pouring out. And every bloom has to make room to root down. Give more, give it all away. I'm sure it'll come back someday. You gotta let go to let it circle back around. To rise up you gotta learn to root down. Learn to root down. Give more, give it all away. I'm sure it'll come back someday. You gotta let go to let it circle back around. To rise up you gotta learn to root down",Pop,Sara Bareilles
This is one more sad song. About the hole you left in my chest. I wrote a million songs for you. You simply wreck me from your heart. And what you wanted me to do?. And I'm here singing this song. Cause loving you constantly broke me. Cause I'm. Cause I'm. I'm broken. You left me no choice. You let everything in my arms. What you expected me to do?. But you wreck me. From your heart first. You never loved me. Like I loved you. And what you expected me to do?. I was broken inside. And I'm still broken. You knew from the beginning. That the end was. Our path. So don't blame me now. Don't blame me now. Just don't blame me now. Cause you wreck me. From your heart first. And I was broken. I'm still broken. You left me no choice. You never loved me like I loved you. We knew from the beginning. That the end. Was our path. That the end. Was our path. And I'm broken. I'm still broken,Pop,Ana Elisa Renault
"Tack. En två tre. (translation: Thanks. One two three). It was a rainy morning.. The leaves fought a hard November.. In a soft unguarded moment she jumped into my life.. She had a blue umbrella with a top of silver.. She wore a coat in shiny tangerine like the firy southern sky.. Oh I, I wanted to show her. that I'd really like to get to know her,. that I didn't mind to spend some time.. She turned at the bookstore, seemed to stop to buy a paper,. I noticed from behind two trucks with engines roaring wild.. When I made my crossing I saw that blue umbrella disappear into this crowded bus.. I watched the red taillights.. Oh I, I wanted to show her (I really wanted to show her). that I'd really like to get to know her,. that I didn't mind to spend some time.. There are lonely nights when she disappears from my bed.. I wish I knew what goes on in her head.. What goes on in her head?.

I found the one whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go. I found the one whom my soul loves. I held him and I would not let him go. I wanna stay in your arms. I never want to let go. I wanna stay in your arms. I never want to let go. Many waters cannot quench love. Neither can flaws drown it. And it's flashes are flashes of fire. The very light of the lord. Set me as a seal upon your heart. A seal upon your soul. Upon your soul. As a seal upon your heart. A seal upon your soul. Upon your soul. I found the one whom my soul loves. I held him and would not let him go. I found the one whom my soul loves. I held him and I would not let him go,Pop,Cimorelli
I'm having the day from hell. It was all going so well before you came. And told me you needed space. With a kiss on the side of my face... not again. And not to mention the tears I shed. When I should have kicked your ass instead. I need intervention. Attention to stop temptation to scream... baby. Chorus:. Everything is f'ed up. Straight from the heart. Tell me what do you do. When it all falls apart. Gotta pick myself up. Where do I start. ‘Cause I can't turn to you. When it all falls apart. Don't know where I parked my car. Don't know who my real friends are anymore. I put my faith in you. What a stupid thing to do... when it pours. And not to mention I drank to much. I'm feelin' hungover and out of touch. I need intervention. Attention to stop temptation to scream... baby. Repeat Chorus. Can't it be easier? Can't I just change my life?. ‘Cause it just seems to go bad everytime. Will I be mending?. Another one ending once again. Repeat Chorus,Pop,The Veronicas

"You can see it on her face. Her red eyes say she's not safe. How should she know what it means. She is only just a teen. Under her duvet's where she hides. To block the screaming late at night. She can't remember life before. Mama and Daddy went to war. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones. Packed the small bag of things she loves. Deep inside she blames herself. She has nowhere else to go. But that sounds better than what she knows. And as she steps into the dark. Dirty hair and heavy heart. Cold, cold air inside her lungs. Catch a snowflake on her tongue. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones. And as I heard you shut the door. Went through the window and I saw. The footsteps of my big sister in the snow. Since then not a single day has passed. Where I don't say your name and ask. Where, where did you go?. All little girls are full of confusion. Cry all you want coz you're only human. Was all the love just an illusion?. Daddy's not coming home. Mama's asleep and she smells of whiskey. Promise that won't be you when you're 50. Cry before the guilty clap your wings. Coz all you're heroes. Are skin and bones",Pop,James Blunt
"I know I know. I know where to go. I know I know. I know where to go. I have forgotten what it's like to walk alone. Running around at night to find another zone. Imagination is the key that carries me. No destination for me. No destination for me. Predictability has allways been the same. I wanna break it down. I wanna break the chain. Sometimes it feels like I am caught up in the mix. Looking for a different place. That I can get my kicks. Please stop making me stop. I won't do what you tell me. Can't be something I'm not. Can't be where I don't wanna be. You can't hold me back. You break me. Please stop making me stop. Can't be where I don't wanna be. I know I know. I know where to go. I always wonder how to get from here to there. It's getting closer million miles from anywhere. Communication is reserved for yesterday. I'm gettin ready to pay,. I'm gonna have it my way. My motivation is to get the hell away. As soon as seasons has prepared me for today. Something is changing and my vision is coming clear. I'm not a child anymore. I run away from here. Please stop making me stop. I won't do what you tell me. Can't be something I'm not. Can't be where I don't wanna be. You can't hold me back. You break me. Please stop making me stop.

"Misty morning, clouds in the sky. Without warning, a wizard walks by. Casting his shadow, weaving his spell. Funny clothes, trinkling bell. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic. Evil power disappears. Demons worry when the wizard is near. He turns tears into joy. Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic. Sun is shining, clouds have gone by. All the people give a happy sigh. He has passed by, giving his sign. Left all the people feeling so fine. Never talking. Just keep walking. spreading his magic",Rock,Black Sabbath
"So, so you think you can tell. Heaven from hell. Blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field. From a cold steel rail?. A smile from a veil?. Do you think you can tell?. Did they get you to trade. Your heroes for ghosts?. Hot ashes for trees?. Hot air for a cool breeze?. Cold comfort for change?. Did you exchange. A walk on part in the war. For a lead role in a cage?. How I wish. How I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls. Swimming in a fish bowl. Year after year. Running over the same old ground. What have we found?. The same old fears. Wish you were here",Rock,Pink Floyd

I'm on the high ridge looking down. On how we are evolving in it all. If I get back then I'll be grateful. Look there's a billboard on the moon. Let me take you this far. This crossing isn't far for me. There's lightning in the storm clouds. And I'll send you there this day. You got me lost in Magic City. You got me questioning it all. I hope that I make it home by Wednesday. And this Magic City lets me go. (Magic City). (Magic City). (Magic City). (Magic City). You put me up there in the penthouse. And painted me in the whites and blue. But I filled the canyon with my ego. Look there's a billboard on the moon. You got me lost in Magic City. You got me questioning it all.

What can I do with my obsession?. With the things I cannot see. Is there madness in my being?. Is it wind that blows the trees?. Sometimes you're further than the moon. Sometimes you're closer than my skin. And you surround me like a winter fog. You've come and burned me with a kiss. And my heart burns for you. And my heart burns. And I'm so filthy with my sin. I carry pride like a disease. You know I'm stubborn God and I'm longing. To be close. You burn me deeper than I know. And my heart burns for you. And my heart burns for you,Rock,Flyleaf
Words get tangled on your tongue. And you stumble on your feet when you miss somebody. And everywhere you think you see them. Walking down the street when you miss somebody. When you miss somebody you tell yourself. a hundred thousand times. Nobody ever lives forever so you give it one more try. To wave goodbye wave goodbye. Every hurtful thing you ever said is ringing in your ear. When you miss somebody. And every thing of beauty that you see only brings a tear. When you miss somebody. When you miss somebody you tell yourself everything. will be alright. Try to stand up strong and brave when all you want to do. Is lay down and die. How long I've waited for an answer or a sign. Lonely and weary from this troubled task of trying. To wave goodbye. So now you start to recognize that every single path you see. Leads to a tear in your eye. So wave goodbye wave goodbye..,Rock,Chris Cornell

And I'm just around the corner from the light of day. Just around the corner from the light of day. Well driving 500 miles got 100 to go, yeah. I've got rock and roll music on the radio. I've got a brother on the rig who's from the Gulf Coast. He said the girls down there are really the most, yeah. (chorus). Well I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo.

I know I ask for nothing. And thatâ€™s what I got from you tonight. I guess I thought youâ€™d changed. Leaving becomes too easy. Easy by morning light. I still cannot explain. Is it enough to ask and not receive. Just one more kiss before you turn and leave. When love is over. Over it should be. But something still burns in me. A hundred solid reasons. The answers come in waves. But I'm all for calmer seas. Youâ€™re only lost in the shuffle. But in your usual way. Itâ€™s you who always comes to me. Iâ€™ve burned up pages. Hidden yesterdays. Hereâ€™s one more glance before I turn away. When love is over. Over it should stay. But something wonâ€™t go away. Hardly a moment passes. Hardly a single day goes by. Iâ€™m not remembering. Just to surrender slowly. Into a strangerâ€™s arms. But you stand watching in the wings. These must be days weâ€™ve seen through tear-filled eyes. It all makes painful sense when I realize. When love is over. Something has to die. Cause you can say goodbye.,Rock,Sheryl Crow

"Wandering through a desert. Traveling aimlessly. Blistering sun, dancing sand. Lost between mirages and reveries. Courage to Begin. Strength to Believe. Hope to carry forward. Fear and dread consume us. Hold tightly to our life. Not even a choice, no chance of escape. From the desert haze. Crazy Vagrant who dares to ramble about. On these lands Forbidden to pests like you. You must be stuck, ran out of luck. Deciphering what I have for you. Is the only way through. Squeeze you tight. Bind your mind. With my wits and power, poisonous words. Paralyzing riddle, bewitch your mind. Like violent acid, meltin' your face. Those muted by my questions. I will devour limb by limb. Now riddle me this. Decipher it quick. Or you'll be her bitch. Beast will grip you till your brain pops out. Son of enigma. Sun of the desert. Trial you will have to pass. And put your little mind to the test. A distant memory of legend of these lands. Never thought it was true. You never think these will ever happen to you. Wandering for ages in these wastelands. Need to find a way to carry forward. Demon enjoy its psycho games. Now the sphinx questions you. Who you are?. What are you?. No turning back anymore. Only way to escape. Wits and words fails me. Questions runs too deep. Keeps you always incomplete. No way out, no running away. Seeking answers is the only way. Never felt sun in flesh. Never let acid melt. Asking question we. Were not supposed to. Impossible answers. Enigmas undeciphered. Wits and words fails me. Questions runs too deep. Keeps you always incomplete. No way out, no running away. Seeking the answer is the only way. Hold your breath. Don't cross the line. Fear from death. She'll chop your mind. Just hear me out, This is my stream of thought. Carry on, chop me up Misses sphinx beyond. Limb by Limb, see if I care, no spell could ever jinx me consequently. This loony tuney, crazy wandering lost soul is me. I promise I won't stutter anymore. Here take this acid, melt your brain, until you're leaking through the floor. You want me to Integrate this Trip? What's the matter? Does. Fear get you by your balls just a little bit?. I believe I asked a question where's your answer little bitch?. What? you can't integrate this trip, Little bitch. Don't overthink it, let your third eye give you a lift. I launched off Heroic doses of 'shrooms blacked out and. Woke up in a straight jacket locked in a tomb. My life was depicted on the wall in encrypted. With blood stained hieroglyphics, it was clear and vivid. I wonder if I got the question right or did I miss it? (B). Did I defy the law of physics or am I just trippin?. Man. Mama I've hit my head. Maybe I've been replaced. Mama I'm not myself. Maybe I'm just insane. Demon head. Lion threat. If I can't get free so easily. Then I'll get high. Holy Mountain high. Insane like the riddle and make no sense at all. And I will put fire on this desert. Answer me this. Have you ever asked yourself Na Na Na Na. What lies behind backstage doors. Have you ever?. It makes you mad. Makes you question everything. What makes you mad. Will kill you everyday. Wits and words fails me. Questions runs too deep. No end, no oasis in sight. No way out. No runnin' away from this. You could call me. An escapist. Maybe that's the shit I am. Wait a sec, don't cut us yet. Never prepared to get chopped like that. Crank that Windows open for.

"I saw a newspaper picture from the political campaign. A woman was kissing a child, who was obviously in pain. She spills with compassion, as that young child's. face in her hands she grips. Can you imagine all that greed and avarice. coming down on that child's lips. Well I hope I don't die too soon. I pray the Lord my soul to save. Oh I'll be a good boy, I'm trying so hard to behave. Because there's one thing I know, I'd like to live. long enough to savour. That's when they finally put you in the ground. I'll stand on your grave and tramp the dirt down. When England was the whore of the world. Margaret was her madam. And the future looked as bright and as clear as. the black tarmacadam. Well I hope that she sleeps well at night, isn't. haunted by every tiny detail. 'Cos when she held that lovely face in her hands. all she thought of was betrayal. And now the cynical ones say that it all ends the same in the long run. Try telling that to the desperate father. who just squeezed the life from his only son. And how it's only voices in your head and dreams you never dreamt. Try telling him the subtle difference between justice and contempt. Try telling me she isn't angry with this pitiful discontent. When they flaunt it in your face as you line up for punishment. And then expect you to say ""Thank you"" straighten up,. look proud and pleased. Because you've only got the symptoms,. you haven't got the whole disease. Just like a schoolboy, whose head's like a tin-can. filled up with dreams then poured down the drain. Try telling that to the boys on both sides,. being blown to bits or beaten and maimed. Who takes all the glory and none of the shame. Well I hope you live long now, I pray the Lord your soul to keep. I think I'll be going before we fold our arms and start to weep. I never thought for a moment that human life could be so cheap. 'Cos when they finally put you in the ground. They'll stand there laughing. And tramp the dirt down",Rock,Elvis Costello

He found all hands against his own. Found all eyes were looking down. And the sun had left and gone. All his friends could not be found. Don’t talk about. Don’t think about love. She not the one. You’re dreaming of. Don’t talk about it. Can’t live without it. You say you’re alone. He found all hands against his own. He found the sky it turned to grey. And the clouds start rolling in. Got no use for what they say. Got no use for where they been. Don’t talk about. Don’t think about love. She not the one. You’re dreaming of. Don’t talk about it. Can’t live without it.

More complicated than a Rubik's. Won't size 'em cause it's always changing. We walked and talked around in circles. Wasting time I found the truth is undiscovered. The time we're falling like a spotlight. A play you sang in harmony. And the whispers after midnight. Making promises and breaking others. We hide behind our shields. We're hiding what we feel. How long can we go on pretending. Afraid we don't belong. And scared we might be wrong. This life's for giving not for lending. We share it with the understanding. I'll play the pipe and then you call the tune. Take our places with the dances. Moving round the tables one after the other. The moves we made were shadow-boxing. I brought the punches and you did the same. Baby better if we had a rumble. Than crawl into our corners as we recover. We hide behind our shields. We're hiding what we feel. How long can we go on pretending. Afraid we don't belong. And scared we might be wrong. This life's for giving not for lending. Let's take our guard down. Let's start taking chances. We're wasting time to come around. There'll be no guarantee of happy ever after. Stepping loud and feeling free. We'll write another chapter. [?]. Living a casino of the heart. Waiting for the moment. Never mind the ending. Playing safe but knowing that. It's hard to lose a race we didn't start,Rock,Nazareth
"Tragedy Bound. Looking for clues. I'm starting to suspect she likes abuse. I'm starting to feel like she doesn't feel. Is there anybody in there?. Tragedy Bound. She is a mess. Her daddy was a demon watching her dress. He shriveled her down, wore her like a crown. Is there anybody in there?. All her life, she's bound to lose. Tragedy Bound. I feel sick. Her daddy was killed, her feelings were mixed. He wore a hole in her skin, now all the boys look in. Is there anybody in there?. Tragedy Bound. Now she's stuck. She can't even care enough to fuck. She's cutting herself just to see if it works. Is there anybody in there?. All her life, she's bound to lose. Tragedy bound. If I met this man. Whout would I say? How could I speak. How could I speak",Rock,The Bravery
"I put away the knife, the chisel, and the saw. I've locked away my life behind this old, oak door. To make a simple spoon, a token of my love. In hope that maybe soon, it's me you're thinking of.

And you'll escape off in your house. so maybe I'll just hit the highway. and maybe you'll open your mouth. and let it out. I gotta say something.

It's too late the time has come. I've kept this inside me for way too long. Silence will leave me cold. Lost on a highway that never takes me home. [Chorus:]. I want to step aside. I want to give it up. Before I lose it all. It's tearing me inside. The way you break me down. Oh there will come a time. When I will come undone. And you will let me fall. I'll leave it all behind. Before you break me down. The weight of a thousand lies. Promises broken haunt me all the time. You say that you're sure to change. But that black heart reveals that. You'll always stay the same. [Chorus]. I realize. Forgiveness. Is calling. It's calling. I've denied. The reason. I'm falling. I'm falling. So let go. [Chorus],Rock,Alter Bridge
"Now I'm a pretty big man around this town. I got me the hottest little Chevy around. My sweet little '66. She got a yellow front fender and a gray one on the back. But my income tax is comin' and I'm gonna paint her black. Sweet little '66. She got the 396, she got the four on the floor. And those stickers in the window ain't just for show. My sweet little '66. Now old Bubba and me built her back in '79. Then he went into the army so now she's all mine. Sweet little '66. I used to run her down on River Road and make a little dough. Can't afford another ticket so I'm laying kinda low. Me and my '66. Now she ain't too good on gasoline, she burns a little oil. But she was built by union labor on American soil. Sweet little '66.

"Sitting there watching time pass by. Fulfilled with thoughts but no word comes out. Never thought you'd just throw me down. Simple words to you, but make more than sounds. The sun sets as the rain pour down. As I find myself in the good old times. Ghosts of laughter, and lovely pastimes. And a perfect view of you in my mind. I guess it's fine, you were mine. At least used to. Things changed. But I keep on my pursuit. Seeing things in a different view. Said she was not like before. Made her choices, saw the world and one thing to share. ""Keep strong, do the things and don't be scared"". Should I listen or pretend to care?. Many sorts of tricks and lies. These days beliefs last only a while. The kind who laugh and fake a smile. Taken for a sweet goodbye. I guess it's fine, you were mine. At least used to. Things changed. But I keep on my pursuit. Seeing things in a different view. I guess it's fine, you were mine. At least used to. Things changed. But I keep on my pursuit. Seeing things in a different view",Rock,Rascal Experience
"Some time ago a crazy dream came to me,. I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three,. I went to the doctor the very next day. To see what kinda words he could say.. He said it was a bad dream.. I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though,. They were my own dreams and they're only in my head.. I said, ""Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain"". He said, ""Nurse, get your pad, this boy's insane"". He grabbed my arm, I said, ""Ouch!"". As I landed on the psychiatric couch. He said, ""Tell me about it"". Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,. It was all over by quarter past.. I was down in the sewer with some little lover. When I peeked out from a manhole cover. Wondering who turned the lights on.. Well, I got up and walked around. And up and down the lonesome town.. I stood a-wondering which way to go,. I lit a cigarette on a parking meter. And walked on down the road.. It was a normal day.. Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell. And I leaned my head and I gave a yell,. ""Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man."". A shotgun fired and away I ran.. I don't blame them too much though,. I know I look funny.. Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand. I seen a man, I said, ""Howdy friend,. I guess there's just us two."". He screamed a bit and away he flew.. Thought I was a Communist.. Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave,. ""Let's go and play Adam and Eve."". I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'. When she said, ""Hey man, you crazy or sumpin',. You see what happened last time they started."". Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown. And there was nobody aroun',. I got into the driver's seat. And I drove 42nd Street. In my Cadillac.. Good car to drive after a war.. Well, I remember seein' some ad,. So I turned on my Conelrad.. But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill,. So the radio didn't work so well.. Turned on my player-. It was Rock-A-Day, Johnny singin',. ""Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa,. Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah."". I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,. I needed somebody to talk to.. So I called up the operator of time. Just to hear a voice of some kind.. ""When you hear the beep. It will be three o'clock,"". She said that for over an hour. And I hung it up.. Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,. Sayin, ""Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams,. But mine was a little different you see.. I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.. I didn't see you around."". Well, now time passed and now it seems. Everybody's having them dreams. Everybody sees themselves. Walkin' around with no one else. Half of the people can be part right all of the time. Some of the people can be all right part of the time. But all of the people can't be all right all of the time. I think Abraham Lincoln said that. ""I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours"". I said that",Rock,Bob Dylan

All of our bridges burnt down. I've wasted my nights. You turned out the lights. Now I'm paralyzed. Still stuck in that time when we called it love. But even the sun sets in paradise. I'm at a payphone trying to call home. All of my change, I spent on you. Where have the times gone. Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two. If happy ever after did exist. I would still be holding you like this. And all those fairytales are full of shit. One more fucking love song I'll be sick. You turned your back on tomorrow. Cause you forgot yesterday. I gave you my love to borrow. But you just gave it away. You can't expect me to be fine. I don't expect you to care. I know I said it before. But all of our bridges burnt down. I've wasted my nights.

Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream. I don't wanna do it like my daddy did. I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid. This is my calling. I said my darling. Shocking appalling. All I can do to you. Hammers are falling. I said my darling. Shocking appalling. All I can do to you. This is the place where all the devils plead. Their case to take from you what they need. Can I isolate your gene. Can I kiss your dopamine. In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine. I don't wanna say it if it isn't so. I don't wanna weigh it but I gotta know. This is my calling. I said my darling. Shocking appalling. All I can do to you. Hammers are falling. I said my darling. Shocking appalling. All I can do to you. I saw you out there yesterday. What did you wanna say. A perfect piece of DNA. Caught in a flashing ray. I caught you out there in the fray. What did you wanna say. A masterpiece of DNA. Caught in a flashing ray. Can I smell your gasoline. Can I pet your wolverine. On the day my best friend died. I could not get my copper clean. I don't wanna take it up with little Joe. I don't wanna fake it but I gotta know. This is my calling. I said my darling. Shocking appalling. All I can do to you. Hammers are falling. I said my darling. Shocking appalling. All I can do to you. I am a misfit. I'm born with all of it. The fucking ultimate of love inside the atom split. I'm in a flash ray. A mash of DNA.

I've been lost in a sea of faces. I've been living in a hotel. I've been trying so hard to erase this. Pain's got me crawling back in my shell. So tired of always feeling like a stranger in my skin. I don't wanna be alone. Always feeling like an alien. I don't wanna be alone. Always feeling like an alien. And I don't wanna be alone. I've been walking in my sleep for ages. I've been hiding from the shadows. I've been feeling so afraid and anxious. This time won't let me go. I think it's time I let you in. Can we start over again?. I don't wanna be alone. Always feeling like an alien. I don't wanna be alone. I've been everywhere and back again. I don't wanna be alone. Always feeling like an alien. Close my eyes and I am home. I close my eyes and I am home. I close my eyes and I am home. I close my eyes. I don't wanna be alone. Always feeling like an alien. I don't wanna be alone. I've been everywhere and back again.

"I used to sit in a big apple tree. Welcome the sun as he shone down on me. Watch the fruit ripen, smell the land grow. Felt the fall rains get colder and turn into snow.. And in the summer, I'd walk through the trees. Roll up my trousers way over my knees. Waded a stream 'til rocks hurt my feet. The water was cool and the summer was sweet.. Autumn got lonely when harvest came 'round. Green leaves turned golden and fell to the ground. Clear nights got colder, stars bright above. And in the winter, I first fell in love.. She loved me truly 'til winter passed by. Left without warning and never said why. Maybe she's lonely, needs me somewhere. Maybe by summer I won't even care.",Rock,Johnny Rivers

Still the willow weeps. On roses for the dead. In laughs of love. . From the likes of her. To time of me. Like to moon to earth. Or the sky to sea. Only were no longer. Allowed to be, to be. . Somewhere in the dreams. Of those who should. Live in all the keeps. Echo all the worlds. In laughs of love. . For times that pass my life. I'll search for the sky. That she wonders by. . Somewhere in the dreams. That the skies hold. Still the willow weeps. On roses for her bed. In laughs of love",Rock,Soundgarden
"I stepped out of the St. James Hotel, I'd left you behind curled up like a child. A change is gonna come, and as the door whispered shut. I walked on down the high-windowed hall. You lay sleeping on the unmade bed, the weatherman on the television. In the St. James Hotel said that the rains are gonna come. And I stepped out on the street all sparkling clean with the early morning dew. Maybe it was you or maybe it was me?. You came on like a punch in the heart. You lying there with the light on your hair like a Jesus on the moon. A Jesus of the planets and the stars. Well, I kept thinking about what the weatherman said. And if the voices of the living can be heard by the dead. Well, the day is gonna come when we find out. And in some kinda way I take a little comfort from that (now and then). Cause people often talk about being scared of change. But for me I'm more afraid of things staying the same. Cause the game is never won by standing in any one place for too long. Maybe it was you or maybe it was me?. But there was a chord in you I could not find to strike. You lying there with all the light in your hair like a Jesus of the moon. A Jesus of the planets and the stars. I see the many girls walking down the empty streets. And maybe once or twice one of them smiles at me. You can't blame anyone for saying hello. I say hey, I say hello, I say hello. Will it be me or will it be you?. One must stay and one depart. You lying there in a St. James Hotel bed. Like a Jesus of the moon. A Jesus of the planets and the stars. I say hello, hello, hello",Rock,Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds

Black cards in effigy. We sing the song that was hated. All dressed like vagabonds. Sharks smell the blood that I'm bleedin'. I know there's something wrong. Might take a fire to kill it. Might take a hurricane. Don't know the life that I'm leavin'. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. My baby run to me. She lives in broken-down buildings. Can't pay the rent again. These spider webs are my home now. And when the sun is down. We'll shake and rattle our bodies. To keep it warm at night. My tambourine is still shaking. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. Ohh ohh oh black tambourine. Doo doo doo doo. Black cards in effigy. We sing the song that was hated. All dressed like vagabonds.

It doesn't get any lonelier than this. I believe my heart'll break. Tonight I prayed I'd die before I wake. With every breath I'm tastin' your kiss. And it's sweet upon my tongue. Until the bitter tears fall one by one. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. 'Cause I'm on this road alone. My heartbeat ringin' like a hollow drum. I'm about as lonesome as a poor boy gets. And there's nothin' I can do. 'Cause it's dark out here and I can't find you. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. I'm as blue as blue can be. Just an empty place where your love should be. I'm sick and tired of walkin' around like this. With my heart outside my skin. Scared to death we'll never touch again. It doesn't get any lonelier than this. And there's no place I can go. Just the dusty corners that the shadows know. Maybe this is as good as it's gonna get. And I'll always be this way. I'll just wander this world callin' out your name. It doesn't get any lonelier than this,Rock,Steve Earle

Corcovado parted the sky. And through the darkness. On us He shined. Crucified in stone. Still His blood is my own. Glory behold all my eyes have seen. I am blessed to be a witness. Some have flown away. And can't be with us here today. Like the hills of my home. Some have crumbled and now are gone. Gather around for today won't come again. I am blessed to be a witness. So much sorrow and pain. Still I will not live in vain. Like good questions never asked. Is wisdom wasted on the past. Only by the grace of God go I. I am blessed to be a witness.,Rock,Ben Harper

On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert. I pick up my money and head back into town. Driving cross the Waynesboro county line. I got the radio on and I'm just killing time. Working all day in my daddy's garage. Driving all night chasing some mirage. Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land. I've done my best to live the right way. I get up every morning and go to work each day. But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold. Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode. Explode and tear this town apart. Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart. Find somebody itching for something to start. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands. Mister I ain't a boy no I'm a man. And I believe in a promised land. There's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor. I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm. Gonna be a twister to blow everything down. That ain't got the faith to stand its ground. Blow away the dreams that tear you apart. Blow away the dreams that break your heart. Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted. CHORUS:. The dogs on Main Street holw 'cause they understand. If I could take one moment into my hands.

Promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Chance as love takes a train. Summer breeze and brilliant light. One love she sees. He controls on love. Love sails to a new life. Promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Only love she sees. He controls on love. Life mirrors a cure. Everything is possible. With promises. Everything is possible. Oh no. I promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Chance reflects on them a while. Love screams so quietly. Slipping back on golden times. Breathing with sweet memories. Promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Only love she sees. He controls on love. Life mirrors a cure. Everything is possible in the game of life. Everything is possible. Oh no. Chance lost pearls of great price. Take care of family. Only aches for love. Love waits for fame. In chance in chance they'll see. I promised you a miracle. Belief is a beauty thing. Promises promises. As golden days break wondering. Only love she sees. He controls on love. Life throws a cure. Everything is possible in the game of life. A burning dream. You can be Queen.

What a guy, what a fool am I. To think my breaking heart could kid the moon. What's in store, should I phone once more. No it's best that I stick to my tune. I get along without you very well.

"The chains from the bridle and the reins fell from my hands. The engines are idle and the ship sails on dry land. I stood there stupefied, I thought I recognized. Walking down Rocking Horse Road, getting lost. Shot through Vaseline, he picks up the paper from the lawn. And tucks ""The Suburban Assassin"" underneath his arm. He smiles weakly and turns away. I know you'll never come to harm. Walking down Rocking Horse Road, it's so peaceful. It's like a photograph. From the other side of the world. I said ""I want you only"". And then I left you alone. Crying on Rocking Horse Road, or somewhere quite like it. The cemetery gardens, there are names not numbers on the gateposts. And the eyes in the curtain follow you like a smirking ghost. I know I must not look back. 'Cause part of me is waiting still. There on Rocking Horse Road for you. In a little dream house made for two. Well you were the one that made your escape. In your stocking feet and your sticky tape. All the way down [repeat to fade].",Rock,Elvis Costello

"There's a cross up yonder up on Calvary Hill. There's a slip of blood on a silver knife. There's a graveyard kid down below. Where at night did come to life. And above the stars, they crackle in fire. A dead man's moon throws seven rings. Well, we put our ears to the cold grave stones. This is the song they'd sing. We are alive. And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark. Our spirits rise to carry the fire and light the spark. To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. A voice cried out, I was killed in Maryland in 1877. When the railroad workers made their stand. Well, I was killed in 1963 one Sunday morning in Birmingham. Well, I died last year crossing the southern desert. My children left behind in San Pablo. Well they left our bodies here to rot. Oh please let them know. We are alive. Oh, and though we lie alone here in the dark. Our souls will rise to carry the fire and light the spark. To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. Let your mind rest easy, sleep well my friend. It's only our bodies that betray us in the end. I awoke last night in a dark and dreamy deep. From my head to my feet, my body had gone stone cold. There were worms crawling all around me. Fingers scratching at an earth black and six foot low. And alone in the blackness of my grave. Alone I'd been left to die. Then I heard voices calling all around me. The earth rose above me, my eyes filled with sky. We are alive. And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark. Our souls and spirits rise. To carry the fire and light the spark. To fight shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. We are alive",Rock,Bruce Springsteen

You're with me tonight on this dark highway. We've run it together. So many times. We've run it for money. We've run it for music. We've run it to pay for our innocent crimes.

It was not in my vision. It was not in my mind. To return from a mission. A man left behind. Here's one to glory. And survival. And stayin' alive. It's the runnin' man's bible. I don't speak of the times I've nearly died. I don't speak of out lastin' those who are gone. Or the things I've done. I care not to remember. Or the desperate measures. That might have been wrong.

He says he looks in the mirror. And he can't tell anymore. Who he really is and who they believe him to be. And he says he walks a thin line. Between what is and what could be. He's getting closer. To something he can't understand. Cause there's a crack in his plastic crown. And his throne of ice is melting. He climbed his ladder. And there was nothing there. And now it's a long way down. Cause on and on and on he goes. Dancing on the grave. Of what he thought was still alive. On and on and on he goes. Dancing in mansions made of twigs. And castles made of sand. He says his head is filled with. Cartoons and fairy tales. And he's trapped inside a dungeon of dolls. With smiles on their faces. He's built a pretty cage. His shows on a beautiful stage. With candy coated prison bars. And chains that look like jewelry. Cause there's a crack in his plastic crown. And his throne of ice is melting. He climbed his ladder. And there was nothing there. And now it's a long way down. Cause he lives inside. A fairy tale sand castle now. And there's room inside. For false expectations and illusions,Rock,Lifehouse

As I sit watching her eyes close,. I slowly open mine.. And be near,. Just for the moment,. Stay here,. Never go home.. Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?. So it goes,. The story of a broken heart comes true, comes true.. I am so confused by this.. I know that life is hit or miss.. Days are stung by too much sun,. I think that you may be the one.. Cover yourself up in me,. Shrouded in what could have been.. I will listen to your pain,. If you listen to me.. Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?. So it goes, as the story of a broken heart comes true,. Did you know that everything she ever does is for you?. And I know, the story of a broken heart comes true,. Come true,. True,. It comes true.

In your isolation... why can't you see? (what I see..). I wonder if the lights out. I wonder if they're listening. Hold me, lay your shame away.. Show me where your lovers stay.. Hold me lay your ghosts away.. Show me for yourself.. You are lost and alone -. But a prisoner of your pride. When the passions you ignore you can never hide... One of these days you're going to find out. 'Cuz one of these days you're going to try. And what did I say to make you wind up, with this spear of guilt inside. What I wonder if the lights out. What I wonder if they're listening. (chorus). -. (Na na, na-na-na, naaa). (Na na, na-na-na, naaa). (Na na, na-na-na, naaa). (Na na, na-na-na, naaa). Hold me... (Na na, na-na-na, naaa). Show me...

"Helen of Troy was the kind of girl. Who really had it all. Not a care in the world but her head was turned. And forever changed. She said one love is lost but another is found. So just take the keys and let's just go, birds fly south. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. It's all about love. So I'm not to blame. I'm not to blame. She said I've dotted my i's and I've crossed my t's. Had time for friends when they needed me. I try to make sense of senseless things. Try to live how I believe. And of course I leave things behind that I'll regret. But there's time enough for new things. yet, for new things yet. When the dust covers the sun. And all you hope for is undone. Will you turn and say. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. It was all for love so love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. Love is to blame. When the dust covers the sun. And all you hope for is undone. Will you turn and say. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. It was all for love so love is to blame.

"I've tried to ignore. All the stench of your life. Only holding back. For my wife. Even she has seen. Your poisoned soul displayed. Seen each move you've made. Contaminate, degrade. Who's this juvenile?. Who's this infantile clown?. He's not ever worth. Knocking down. Stamp your tiny foot. My precious little lamb. Bleat ad nauseam. But I don't give a damn. Where to go? Heart ever hounded. Coward? No - spirit confounded. Always hoping belief will bring release. God alone can give me peace. Watching me scream and hate. Only choosing when it's too late. May this imbecile. Cause your heart to feel joy. You did after all. Choose the toy. Do you now suppose. I'll leave with no reply?. Basic laws apply. An eye demands an eye. Where to go? Heart ever hounded. Coward? No - spirit confounded. Always hoping belief will bring release. God alone can give peace. Watching me scream and hate. Only choosing when it's too late",Rock,Cliff Richard

When I'm stable long enough. I start to look around for love. See a sweet and floral print. My mind begins the arrangements. But when I start to feel that pull. Turns out I just pulled myself. She would never go with me. Were I the last girl on earth. (Chorus). I'm dumb she's a lesbian. I thought I had found the one. We were good as married in my mind. But married in my mind's no good. A pink triangle on her sleeve. Let me know the truth. Let me know the truth. Might have smoked a few in my time. But never thought it was a crime. Knew the day would surely come. When I'd chill and settle down. When I think I've found a good old fashioned girl. Then she put me in my place. If everyone's a little queer. Can't she be a little straight. (Chorus),Rock,Weezer
Look at the faces. Whose is the meaning. Forget the passion. Feeding the dead. The fall of because. Look at the faces. It's cold outside. You're on your own. Staying indifferent. The fall of because. It's cold outside. Losing my fear. No more passion. Passion is fed. Because.,Rock,Killing Joke

"I went up to the mountain, apocalypse dreams in my head. There was fire upon the horizon but it was just the sunrise turning red. Maybe it's time, maybe it's time . .. Each night I walk to the edge of the city out to where the darkness begins. Made a promise out here a long time ago and I've been waiting ever since. Maybe it's time, maybe it's time . .. My world has become an empty place. Of great, wide landscapes and weird painted skies. Strange patterns and islands of light. And people move as shadows never touching at all.

"She says nobody wants to believe. You're the same as everyone.. What makes me unique?. My Dark Life. There was a kink in the world. Sent that statue tumbling. An invitation east. So we can watch it all crumbling. She came off like light and so softly she spoke:. ""You don't know, no you don't know about my dark life"". And you think you're a guest, you're a tourist at best. Peering into the corners of your dark life. Now that you tear your dreams from consumptive ballerinas. She'd stand on tiptoes for you in a grey and tattered tutu. She stays where she is because of voyeurs like these. With an accusative look that says. My Dark Life. Robber men await you then in each beguiling alley. To shake you and to pierce you and remind you of. My Dark Life. Enter the pious elite, in their preening finery. And bang the tambourine. They're dining on rice paper scenery. See how the villain attracts envious glances from everyone. She's waitressing by day. It doesn't bring in much money now. And his strong concealed arms set off bells and alarms. In the strangest locations of. My Dark Life. But the fantasy slipped as he tipped her in cigarettes. She tries to smile very graciously when she wants to kill him. Now the victory is sweet, you'll get down on your knees. It's the perfect position for kissing western leather. So they came from Ugly Texas and from Nameless Tennessee. From Peculiar Missouri and from places closer to me.. All the cream of heartless England, cheered the carnival is over. There are remnants of red army bandsmen. Played ""America The Beautiful"".",Rock,Elvis Costello

Locked up from hell so tight. This place is dark and dirty. I've been here too many times. My blood in purgatory. Cry out but no one answers. Silence consumes my mind. Another morning after. A truth I can't deny. When the stars are falling. And worlds collide. You feel like you won't survive. I'm bruised and broken. But I'm hanging on. As long as I am. Alive. You say I'm so diluted. You say that I am blind. You say that I will never seek the will I find. I say you'll never know me. You are no friend of mine. And I'm going to fuck you up and set your world on fire. When the stars are falling. And worlds collide. You feel like you won't survive. I'm bruised and broken. But I'm hanging on. As long as I am. Alive,Rock,Escape The Fate
"""Sure God's all powerful, but does he have lips? Whoa..."". Dear God, how have you been then?. I'm not fine, fuck pretending. All of this death your sending. Best throw some free heart mending. Invite you in my heart, then. When done, my sins forgiven?. This God of mine relaxes. World dies I still pay taxes. Can I be as my God am. Can you be as God am. Can I be as my God am. God of all my God am. So Lord, I see you grinnin. Must be grand always winning. How proud are you being able. To gather faith from fable. Can I be as my God am. Can you be as God am. Can I be as my God am. God of all my God am. God am. My God am. God am. God. All the respect I'm giving. Shared strength acquired by living. All blooming life you're feeding. Can't hide sick ones you're weeding. Can I be as my God am. Can you be as God am. Can I be as my God am. God of all my God am. God am. God am. God am. God am. .",Rock,Alice In Chains

And I can't swim the ocean like this forever. And I can't breathe. God keep my head above water. I lose my breath at the bottom. Come rescue me. I'll be waiting. I'm too young to fall asleep. God keep my head above water. Don't let me drown. It gets harder. I'll meet you there at the altar. As I fall down to my knees. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown. Don't let me drown.

"""Grandpa, here's your coffee"". said Edith, as she filled his cup. ""Nobody'll find you here. and Earl is glad you guys showed up"". "" The way things are downtown. you might have to stay for awhile. There was a helicopter hovering over your house. when I talked to your neighbor, Kyle"". ""Who the hell do they think they are. Invading our home like that?. Grandma and I had to leave so fast. We couldn't even catch the cat"". ""The helicopter scared the shit out of him. and it took off down a trail. down past the railroad track. towards the county jail"". ""Jed, you really screwed up now!. What did you have to do that for?. Everybody wants to hang your ass. and here's a note from Lenore"". Sun touched the cold steel bars. as she pushed the paper in. Jed took it up and read it. and he couldn't hide a grin. Outside the jail window. a crow flew across the sky. completely disappearing behind each bar. then a helicopter flew by. ""Say hi to Earl and Edith. Tell 'm I'm doing fine. Tell 'm it's time for them to let you go now. they should cut the line"". ""Can grandma come and see me?. I got a new song to sing. it's longer than all the others combined. and it doesn't mean a thing"". The noise was unfamiliar. generators whirling. walkie-talkies screaming. vans parked in the open field. TV crews and cameras. they wanted to interview grandpa on the porch. They came through the gate and across the lawn. knocking down Edith's Tiki Torch. And grandpa saw them there. looking through the venetian blind. ""Those people don't have any respect. so they won't get any of mine"". ""I don't wanna talk about Jed. I don't watch channel 2 or 6 or 9. I don't have time to talk that fast. and it ain't my crime"". ""It ain't a privilege to be on TV. and it ain't a duty either. The only good thing about TV. is shows like 'Leave it to Beaver"". ""Shows with love and affection'. like mama used to say. A little Mayberry living. could go a long way"". He took Earl's shotgun down from the closet. loaded up both barrels. Walked out on the porch and fired 'm off. and up walked a woman named Carol. ""Susan Carol from Early Magazine. I got some questions to ask"". ""Well you can stick 'm where the sun don't shine! "". grandpa said with a gasp. Then he fell face first and let out a sigh. and Edith ran out in shock. He was looking at her from down on the floor. Grandpa looked like he was trying to talk. ""That guy just keeps singin'!. Can somebody shut him up?. I don't know for the life of me. where he comes up with that stuff. "". They laid his head on a newspaper. with a picture of Carmichael on the front page. posing with the little league baseball team. and a seedy shot of Jed on a motorcycle. Grandpa died a hero.

And the newspapers didn't cover the story. Just decided to keep it hid.. Somebody started saying it was an inside job. Whatever happened to him?. Last time they saw him down on the Bow'ry. With his lip hanging off an old rusty bottle of gin. Have you ever heard about the so-called hippies. Down on the far side of the tracks. They take the eyeballs straight out of your head.

"Don't look in here, yeah.. Sundown finds him out of town on the overpass,. his inner self glued to his .22.. Dirty metal in the speed of night, lights and broken glass.. My heart can destroy all I see.. Moving streets all make me lonely!. Come to me and be mine only.. I can hide us far from sight, but you must wait and I must fight this nothingness.. Walls, I see my little room.... I hear my parent's friends.. I hope that my actions make amends!. I would like to kill for love but I don't know how.... Here I lie so high above the crowd.. Busy streets all make me lonely!. Come to me and be mine only.. I can move us through the night, but you must wait and I must fight this emptiness.. Black top burns with silent screams.. Others stop my dreams.. Lightning Crash! Crash! Crash!. Fear causes some to live, others die real cool.. I died in the evening after school.. Be mine only.. Be my own.. Be mine only.. Be my own..",Rock,Blondie

"So blinded by my own desire. I blew out our loves first fire. A part of my life has been wasted. By choosing to live recklessly. How did it come to this!. But still your arms are wide open for me. You know I feel dirty. But you've filled your heart with my needs. My life is so broken. But you long to put me back together. How did it come to this!. I can't stand living without you near. Better is one day in your courts. Than a thousand elsewhere. I cry out for help 'cos. I lack the strength, purpose to live. From all of the choices I'll take the only one. That can change me deep within. How did it come to this!. Only you can help me, you alone. Better is one day in your courts. Than a thousand elsewhere. I was enslaved by my heart. Then you broke the chains. And freed me from all my pride. And now I'd rather live at your door. Than starve in the rotten wealth of this earth",Rock,Oficina G3
"I thought I saw you in The Battleship. but it was only a look alike. She was nothing but a vision trick. under the warning light. She was close,. close enough to be your ghost. But my chances turned to toast. when I asked her if I could call her your name. I thought I saw you in The Rusty Hook,. huddled up in a wicker chair. I wandered over for a closer look. and kissed whoever was sitting there. She was close and she held me very tightly. until I asked awfully politely. ""please can I call you her name?"". I elongated my lift home. I let him go the long way round. I smelt your scent on the seat belt. and kept my short cuts to myself. I thought I saw you in The Parrot's Beak. messing with the smoke alarm. It was too loud for me to hear her speak. and she had a broken arm. It was close,. so close that the walls were wet. And she wrote it out in Letraset. ""No, you can't call me her name"". Tell me where's your hiding place. I'm worried I'll forget your face. And I've asked everyone. I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along. I elongated my lift home. I let him go the long way round. I smelt your scent on the seat belt. and kept my shortcuts to myself.

"I was born in a shack in West Tennessee. I picked that cotton down upon my knees. The sun got hotter each and every day. But me and my brothers kept a-pickin' away. Seemed like the sun would never go down. So we could clap our hands and gather around. And do the boogie (boogie). Yeah, I learned the rhythm (boogie woogie rhythm). And it wasn't very long. Till I was doin' the boogie woogie rhythm. Well, I prayed all week for Saturday night. Turn my back on the sun and put the sack out of sight. Take the long dusty road into town. My feet kept the rhythm as I walked the hot ground. But nothing could keep me from my favourite spot. Where the chicks were a-waitin' and the music was hot. Born to boogie (boogie). Lord, I got the rhythm (boogie woogie rhythm). And it wasn't very long. Till I done the boogie woogie rhythm. (Like this I did the boogie). Well, Monday morning was always bad. But it was worth it all for the time I had. Lord oh Lordy, how I wish it would rain. Just the sun have mercy on a country boy's pain. But I make believe everything's all right. Gonna do it again come Saturday night. I do the boogie (boogie). Yeah-yeah, with lots of rhythm (boogie woogie rhythm). Lord, I learned to move by doin' that boogie woogie rhythm.

"Parallel to life. There's a wisdom that seems out of reach. Like a figure of speech. In a maze of white lies. So elusive it's hard to recognize. With naivety's eyes. It's like running with a knife. The thought steals away with your peace. And high on that trapeze. You hold on to me. You hold on to me. And I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. And our sorrows all undone. When you're done with all the strife. When they echo the minds in the streets. You know your heart beats. A solitary call. For a change in the tone of it all. You'll be scaling that wall. And the higher you climb. The more you can see of this life. On the edge of that knife. You hold on to me. Hold on to me. And I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. And our sorrows all undone. Yeah, I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. We are children of the sun. And you know you can take this story. Take your glory. Make your own way. Yeah, I want you to shake this story. Take your glory. Find your way. Make your own way. And I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. And our sorrows all undone. Yeah, I'll be singing you. Songs of tomorrow. And then dawn will follow. We are children of the sun",Rock,Poets Of The Fall

Seven Seas. Stab a sorry heart. With your favourite finger. Paint the whole world blue. And stop your tears from stinging. Hear the cavemen singing. Good news they're bringing. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell. A longing for. Some fresher feeling. Belonging. Or just forever kneeling. Where is the sense in stealing. Without the grace to be it. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell. Burning my bridges. And smashing my mirrors. Turning to see if you're cowardly. Burning the witches with mother religious. You'll strike the matches and shower me. In water games. Washing the rocks below. Taught and tamed. In time with tear flow. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise. Seven seas. Swimming them so well. Glad to see. My face among them. Kissing the tortoise shell,Rock,Echo And The Bunnymen
Every night. Caught up on the same old dream. I hear your broken heart. Crumbling down and haunting me. And everyday. Try to tell myself it ain't so hard. But then I hear your name.

I'll be comin' back for you. I'll move the mountains. Part the sea. Anything for you. I'll be back 'n blue. Back 'n blue. Forget that girl. She could never take your place. It's hard enough. When you look at me that way. I know I was caught red-handed. I wouldn't blame you if you twist the knife. I swear I've come to my senses. Tell me what to do. Anyday I'll make it right. I've got to change the way you feel. If I have to I'll change the world. So help me girl. I'll beg borrow and steal. If that's what it takes. * Repeat. Back 'n blue. Back 'n blue. Back 'n blue. Back 'n blue. At 't-till make you believe me. I'm prepared to make any sacrifice. The shadow of our love keeps gettin' bigger. Without your love I'll sure die. Chorus. Tell you what I'm gonna do.

4 O'Clock in the morning. When the ambulance arrived. 4 O'Clock in the morning. When the ambulance arrived. The blue lights were flashing. As they lay my baby down inside. They took her to the hospital. In the darkest hour of the night. They took her to the hospital. In the darkest hour of the night. It was silent as the grave. As my baby lay beneath the light. They turned on the gas and cut her open. She didn't feel no pain. They turned on the gas and cut her open. She didn't feel no more pain. Daylight was breaking. And down came the rain.

Never stop to let the truth in. (K'naan). Sometimes I feel like it's all been done. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one. Sometimes I wanna change everything I've ever done. I'm too tired to fight and yet too scared to run. (Keane). And if I stop for a minute. I think about things I really don't wanna know. And I'm the first to admit it. Without you I'm a liner stranded in an ice floe. (K'naan). I feel like a thief who has no faith. Maybe more than by the grade. Of the drugs you took that day. Sinking in the pain he's been inflicting. Yet he's feeling like the victim. Just a horoscope's to blame. (Keane). Sometimes I feel like a little lost child. Sometimes I feel like the chosen one. Sometimes I wanna shout out 'til everything goes quiet. Sometimes I wonder why I was ever born. And if I stop for a minute. I think about things I really don't wanna know. And I'm the first to admit it. Without you I'm child and so wherever you go. I will follow. (K'Naan - rap). One... yeah. And baby you are just beautiful from crown to your cuticles. You held down my two sons. You never frown when duty calls. You know me, I gave you more than you can handle. But you still keep a handle on it. Even when I take something beautiful and vandal on it. No more females?. Well how come my emails. Got notes on a scandal. It's like Eve with the apple. A priest in the chapel. Overcome by the devil's tackle. I'm still shackled the bad til I know. I'm such a hassle every time I let my thoughts go. I get baffled so I hardly pause. I just crossed seas with these gnarly broads. Cos it hurts me just to see what I finally lost. So I guess I'm just a fiend. Consumed by the scene. The stage and the screens. Where it's just me and Keane. (Keane). And if I stop for a minute. I think about things I really don't wanna know.

All your twisted thoughts free flow to. Everlasting memories show soul. Kiss the stars with me. And dread the wait for. Stupid calls returning us to life. We say to those who are in love. It can't be true cause we're too young. I know that's true because. So long I was so in love with you. So I thought. A year goes by. And I can't talk about it. On my knees in a dim lighted room. Thoughts free flow try to consume myself in this. I'm not faithless. Just paranoid. Of getting lost or that I might lose. Ignorance is bliss cherish it. Pretty neighborhoods. You learn too much to hold. Believe and not. And fight the tears. With pretty smiles and lies about the time. A year goes by. And I can't talk about it. The times weren't right. And I couldn't talk about it. Choris romance says goodnight. Close your eyes and I'll close mine. Remember you remember me. Choris romance says goodnight. Close your eyes and I'll close mine.

All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea.. Someone's been a bit untidy, they'll have it cleaned up in a week.. But the week is over and now it's grown into years since I was told that I should be calm, there's nothing to fear here.. But I drank that water for years, my wife and my children.. Tell me, where to now, if your fight for a bearable life can be fought and lost in you backyard?. O, don't tell us there's poison in the well,. that someone's been a bit untidy, that there's been a small spill.. All that it amounts to is a tear in a salted sea..

Never in my wildest dreams. Would I be loving you. Never in my wildest dreams. Would my dreams come true. You're just too good to touch. I can't discuss it much. I get too choked up. Don't wanna make a scene. Never in my wildest dreams. Never in my wildest dreams. Would I roam this land. Sail across the seven seas. I'm a hard luck man. But I know what my purpose is. It ain't no some pilgrimage. Its wherever my baby is. My love supreme. Never in my wildest dreams. Walk in the cold cold wind. Carry my laundry bin. Take my recs for a spin. Watch daytime tv. You're just too good to touch. And I can't discuss it much. I get too choked up. Don't wanna make a scene. Never in my wildest dreams,Rock,Dan Auerbach

"I was staring through a telescope at night. at a large light in the sky. Its spinning lights reminded me of you. A star spinning in orbit. lighting up the sky. Or maybe it was not a star at all. I was standing by the Hudson River's edge at night. looking out across the Jersey shore. At a neon light spelling out some cola's name. And I thought your name should be dancing. beamed from satellites. Larger than any billboard in Times Square. Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid. I'm the one who loves you in each and every way. Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid. NYC lovers. Tell it to your heart. (Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid. tell it to your heart). (Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid. tell it to your heart). I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.. I guess I couldn't sleep. And I see this spinning light that I saw last week. Maybe I should wake you up. but by then it might be gone. You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky. I ran outside down a darkened street. listening to my boot heels click. My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette. When I turned the corner. my spinning light was in the street. They were filming a commercial on TV. Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid. we're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy. Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid. NYC Lovers. Tell it to your heart. tell it to your heart. Tell it to your heart. tell it to your heart. (Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid. tell it to your heart).

Walk away slowly. You don't have to take this. In the spaces in between. Sadness on the faces. I could see the chains of love. The chains. Talking 'bout the chains of love. Can't take us away. Storms are brewing in your heart. I don't want to waste it. Better to have tried it all. Least we got to taste it. Locked up in the chains of love. We change. Caught up in the chains of love. Can't take us away. Clouds moving over the house. I think about those days. Wish I had something to relax my mind. Send me off to heaven I've got nothing but time. Lightning in the sky above. Blink and see the traces. Everything you are to me. Is bigger than the spaces. Between us and the chains of love. The chains. Locked up in the chains of love. They can't take us away. Can't take us away. Can't take us away. Can't take us away,Rock,Ryan Adams

I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home. It's good to know your laugh. And you'll always hold my hand. And watch from up in heaven. And always understand. We'll take you down the road. And in everything we do. We'll know how much you love us. A soul that's kind and true. And if you've seen the love that's in her eyes. Then everything is good. And if you know the way she felt inside. She's flying where she should. I never believed we'd ever live to see. An angel being born. And flying home. Ah... Can you see the love in her eyes. If you've seen the love that's in her eyes. Then everything is good. And if you know the way she felt inside. She's flying where she should. I never believed we'd ever live to see.

"I wonder what you'll take from me today. My sanity or just my breath away. It's hard to say. Impossible for me to tell. We're always walking on eggshells. Who you're going to be from day to day. Today. (Chorus). I wish that we could go back. To what we were before. But I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore. I wonder why it is that you don't see. How much you've changed since we first met. And how much that it's killing me. I know that I will always miss. The butterflies of our first kiss. And how you used to smile so easily. I wish that we could go back. To what we were before. But I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore. It's too hard to keep pretending. It's too hard to ignore. I don't think that I love you anymore, anymore. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never thought that it would come to this. I know we'll never get back to how we were before. 'cause I know that I don't love you anymore. It's too hard to keep pretending. It's too hard to ignore. I know that I don't love you anymore, anymore. I'm sorry",Rock,Hoobastank

I threw my robe on in the morning. Watched the ring on the stove turn red. Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee. Pulled on my boots and made the bed. Screen door hangin' off its hinges. Kept bangin' me awake all night. As I look out the window. The only thing in site. Is dry lightning on the horizon line. Just dry lightning and and you on my mind. I chased the heat of her blood. Like it was the holy grail. Descend beautiful spirit. Into the evening pale. Her appaloosa's. Kickin' in the corral smelling rain. There's a low thunder rolling'Cross the mesquite plain. But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line. It's just dry lightning and and you on my mind. I'd drive down to Alvarado Street. Where she'd dance to make ends meet. I'd spend the night over my gin. As she'd talk to her men. Well the piss yellow sun. Comes bringin' up the day. She said 'Ain't nobody can give nobody. What they really need anyway.'. Well you get so sick of the fightin'. You lose your fear of the end. But I can't lose your memory. And the sweet smell of your skin. And it's just dry lightning on the horizonline. Just dry lightning and and you on my mind.,Rock,Bruce Springsteen

Come rest you weary gentlemen. let nothing you dismay. lay down your swords and fight no more. for the sake of Christmas Day.

We don't need a merry Christmas. we don't need a Happy New Year. the only wish on Santa's list. is that one day there will be. peace on this earth.

We don't need a merry Christmas. we don't need a Happy New Year. the only wish on Santa's list. is that one day there will be. peace on this earth.

Hey mister can you help me. I'm a loner on the run. I'm just looking for tomorrow. And I ain't gonna hurt no one. I jumped headfirst into a bottle. I was looking for a friend. Came up just short of nothing. I didn't find the truth I only found an end. So tell me who's gonna save me. Or my father or my son. When the only justice a man can see. Is the barrel... of a loaded gun. I been broke and I've been hungry. I think they're both my middle name. But I don't never ever never seem to get enough. Still guess I can't complain. 'Cause what you get in life you take it. You've gotta hold on and make it last. They say good things come to those who wait. But it's life that goes so fast. And when there's just one rule you live by. Each day you kiss the rising sun. When you live and die by the life we breathe. In the barrel of a loaded gun. Guns talk to me in my sleep at night. And a gun somewhere is burning. With my name. Winners are losers. And losers will have to face. All those yesterdays. And all of the dreams they blew away. So Mister can you help me. Or are you my gun. Have the ghosts of justice. Brought you here to me to taste. The barrel of a loaded gun. There's justice in the barrel. Of a loaded gun.,Rock,Bon Jovi

"The sky grows bigger every day. And the other week I hopped on a train. Cutting through state lines. To come to you as the crow flies. And out there in there offing everything was melon and orange. Did you know, my sweet. That I once took the liberty of watching you in your sleep?. I rolled over and over. Trying to touch your knees underneath the sheets. I just want you to know. that every pool of water reminds me of you. Is that all right?. I hope you think it's cool. 'Cause sometimes a train can't go as fast as I want it to. Everything seemed a little easier. when we weren't one hundred miles apart. The person across from me. sitting in her train seat, reminded me of you. And I looked out past her cheeks. through the glass-light conduit. But the sun had sunk already. Disappeared into New Jersey. Oh, why don't they have phones on these things?",Rock,Third Day

For the want of immunity. Or a bowl of rice?. Well, who would hold a price. On the heads of the innocent children. If there's some immortal power. To control the dice?.

What's the deal? Spin the wheel.. If the dice are hot -- take a shot.. Play your cards. Show us what you got. What you're holding.. If the cards are cold,. Don't go folding.. Lady Luck is golden;.

Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling. So I just did me some talkin' to the sun. And I said I didn't like the way he' got things done. Sleepin' on the job. Those raindrops are falling on my head, they keep falling. But there's one thing I know. The blues he sends to meet me won't defeat me. It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me. Raindrops keep falling on my head. But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red. Crying's not for me. Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'. Because I'm free.",Rock,Manic Street Preachers

Everything is good for you. if it doesn't kill you. everything is good for you. one man's ending. is another man's beginning. everything is good for you.

Callin' out your number--I'll take you for a ride. Find something to keep me satisfied. . Runnin' for the money...layin' out the green. It's a tax accountant's nightmare--it's a rock 'n roll dream. The income may be different but the outcome's still the same. You'll never be a winner boy until you play the game. Hounded to distraction...racin' to and fro. Losin' my direction keepin' up my status quo. Now I tried - tried - tried - tried. It just don't seem to keep me satisfied. . A hundred-thousand miles in a 747. Take it all in style if you wanna get to heaven. Chasin' all the action every single night. Never understand it but you try to do it right. Ragged 'round the edges...none the worse for wear. Cuttin' all the corners but they never get me there. Now I try - try - try - try. It just don't seem to keep me satisfied. .,Rock,Billy Squier

"The Machinist climbs his ferris wheel like a brave and the fire-eater's lyin' in a pool of sweat victim of the heatwave,. Behind the tent the hired hand tightens his legs on the sword swallowers blade,. Circus town's on the shortwave. Well the runway lies ahead like a great false dawn,. Fat lady, big mama, Missy Bimbo sits in her chair and yawns,. And the man-beast lies in his cage sniffin' popcorn and the midget licks his fingers and suffers Missy Bimbo's scorn. Circus town's been born.. And a press roll drummer go, ballerina to-and-fro cartwheelin' up on that tightrope,. With a cannon blast, lightin' flash, movin' fast through the tent, Mars bent,. He's gonna miss his fall, oh God save the human cannonball.. And the flying Zambini's watch Marguarita do her neck twist,. And the ringmaster gets the crowd to count along: 95, 96, 97.. A ragged suitcase in his hand, he steals silently away from the circus grounds,. And the highway's haunted by the carnival sounds. They dance like a great greasepaint ghost on the wind,. A man in baggy pants, a lonely face, a crazy grin, runnin' home to some small Ohio town. Jesus, send some sweet women to save all your clowns. And circus boy dances like a monkey on barbed wire, and the barker romances with a junkie, she's got a flat tire,. And now the elephants dance real funky and the band plays like a jungle fire,. Circus town's on the live wire.. And the strong man Sampson lifts the midget, little Tiny Tim, up on his shoulders, way up, and carries him on down the midway past the kids, past the sailors, to his dimly lit trailer,. And the ferris wheel turns and turns like it ain't ever gonna stop,. And the circus boss leans over and whispers into the little boy's ear, hey son you want to try the big top?. All aboard, Nebraska's our next stop..",Rock,Bruce Springsteen

One last look at visions of flesh. The last best hope of man on Earth. Pontius Pilate still washing his hands. The world don't want to be saved. Only left alone. Elysian Fields.... We are storming the heavens. We raise the swords and shields. We ascend to our destiny. To the Elysian Fields. Soaring to the sun. With blood upon their wings. Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind. Man still has one belief,. One decree that stands alone. The laying down of arms. Is like cancer to their bones.",Rock,Megadeth

I am the seed of a dead age, gone viral. Those feelings I've tried to shake, all my life long. But the demons I'm keeping, are hard to face. When you hide them, so long. I gotta cut you at the root. I gotta save my soul from the bad in you. I gotta cut you through and through. You only ever gave me bitter fruit. Oh and it grew like a shockwave. And I was blindsided. The fruit that your love gave. Poisoned my mind up. I cut your branches at the root. I gotta save my soul from the things you do. I cut your branches through and through. But still I only taste that bitter fruit. Down to the bone. All my love was cut in a single blow. Gone, and I know. All my love was cut in the seed I sowed. I could pray, but can't you see?. The kind of things I pray for are cursing me. I could praw, but can't you see?. The kind of things I pray for. The kind of things I need. I cut your branches at the root.

Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years. Then they expect you to pick a career. When you can't really function you're so full of fear. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV. And you think you're so clever and classless and free. But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see. A working class hero is something to be. A working class hero is something to be. There's room at the top they are telling you still. But first you must learn how to smile as you kill. If you want to be like the folks on the hill.

"Way back deep into the brain. Way back past the realm of pain. Back where there's never any rain.. And the rain falls gently on the town,. And over the heads of all of us.. And in the labyrinth of streams. Beneath, quiet unearthly presence of. Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around,. Reptiles abounding. Fossils, caves, cool air heights.. Each house repeats a mold. Windows rolled. A beast car locked in against morning.. All now sleeping. Rugs silent, mirrors vacant,. Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples. Wound in sheets.. And daughters, smug. With semen eyes in their nipples. Wait. There's been a slaughter here!.",Rock,The Doors
"I don’t know why should I be glad with myself. I just know that, all my feelings are so deep. You runaway from my door and I still here. I’m just thinking about the things I said to you. And how it could be wrong?. But when I close my eyes at night. I know that you’ll be there. When I kissed your lips that night. I knew that I was in love. When I see your face again. Would you even care?. I don’t know why should I be the only one. I just have to understand how things use to be. You runaway from my door and I still here. I’m just thinking about the things you said to me. And how it could be wrong?",Rock,Superdrive

"[Intro]. We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon. And nothing was the same. [Verse 1]. Watch me, going out of the way. When I should've went home. Only time of the day I get to spend on my own. I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib. Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way. We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past. I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh. You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask. I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something. [Hook x2]. Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru. Girl you know we got thangs to do. Girl you know we got thangs to do. So get your ass in that car and come thru. [Verse 2]. Last night I brought DOA to the studio. They already had a stage and a booty pole. Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on. But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on. Someone put a order in for a chicken. Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen. Yeah they know I got the hook-up,. they just wait on me to cook up. Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?. Rap game, Crack game, ain't that different ya know?. Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?. And ya know I need ya back in my life. Girl ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like. Girl you got that thing forreal. When I was on a mission to make it. Who used to sleep on the floor with you. when you lived in the basement?. Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?. I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something. [Hook]. Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru. Girl you know we got thangs to do. Girl you know we got thangs to do. So get your ass in that car and come thru. [Outro]. Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?. Why has it been? Why has it been?. Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?. Who's bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you. Where have you been?. You deserve rounds tonight,. come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight. Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight.

"It's sick out here [x4]. [E-40]. It's sick out here look at the clouds. Look how dark it is out here. Look at all the cars with they lights on in the daylight. Another funeral niggas is stressing pressure busting pipes. Crooked cops want to read my rights, nothing but harming. Blowing shit like baby wipes, no search warrant. Dick off in your lig-a-ment. What they find, some straight instruments. I got the town buckled like a belt. Within a few, I bail. 200,000 was the bomb had to think. Ten percent of that is 20,000. Inner-city bumping a thousand, suckas be dowsing. Finding Jerry cats and mousing, infiltrating and doubting. Uh, I don't know why we all so invious. Too many chiefs, and not enough indians. [Chorus x4]. It's sick out here. Sick, sick, sick, sick. [E-40]. There's fortune on the block. Every five minutes, here come the cops. I got a mouth full of hubba-rocks. And about 3 thou-wow in my sock. Plus a clock in ass cheek, Chairliggan's big brother. Stomach about to bust, no Medicaid coverage. In this game you can't be doofy. Got to have some game, can't be game goofy. Can't be out there claiming hard, when you soft. Squares are poking out of cars, tare that off. Take the scene that crowd. Be about your war, or a route. [Chorus]. [Suga T]. What you gone do when they come for you. Better be ready better call your crew. If you don't pass the test, they'll put you to rest. Nigga stay on your toes, nigga be at your best. It's that thug shit, mean mugging nigga break bread. You get nothing if you ain't put nothing in. [E-40]. I heard they took the T out of trust, in other words rust. Where my real niggas, ain't no more of us. Quick to kill niggas, there's a lot of us. On a mission for that meal ticket on restriction. Incense burning in the kitchen, just pay the vision. Follow one time in my mixed up dirty piston. But barely working on my third uh-striking. On a good one man, everyday is thanksgiving.

Now you back where you begin while I'm livin on ten. Got inns sittin in a Benz wit rims sippin on Hen. Wit Stokes, Twist, and Mayze while you broke bitch I'm paid. Should of stayed but betrayed look at the cheddar you could have made. You started with the mob thought you was harder than the mob. But ain't no one motherfucker larger than this mob. Swear to god, for y'all C-Wall ain't got love. No only one that's gonna be on you side is this hot slug. For the dead and locked I'm throwin my mob up.

But you out your death wish so if I miss you'll be facin barrels by midknight. And that's on these four fingers I hold high. Anybody who crosses my mobsta family they die. I hollered at my boy James to bless me wit some mo' thangs. A mobstaz hard to kill like stopping off of cocaine. I'm leavin out sweated no dynasty clicks crushin bitches wit this. Nigga your songs ain't shit, they can't even fade our skits eat a dick. [Chorus]. Nigga cross the mob so what's up. In every destination retaliation gotta fuck 'em up. Nigga cross the mob so what's up. In every destination retaliation gotta get 'em up. Shit are y'all about ready to die for this fetti fuck everyting that's petty. Down to do dirt lets put in work. Stay together whether we rappin of slangin ye together. Get the paper but don't cross the mob and get hurt loyalty's first. [Traxster]. When everything was all good y'all niggas threw the wall up. But when the shit hit the fan I watch you bitches ball up. Now you time is all up, fuck who you call up. My niggas all bust, my killas all nuts. What the fuck you call us, what you say about C-Wall. Playa hatin how we ball, nigga we'll be to see y'all. And you mob gonna end up the same homie, put this pain on you. No love my slugs got them thugs name on 'em.

Cause the trigger work you. Bust all of you bitches and all of you hoes. When the bruh come. Thugs betta run shit look at what thugs want. See what drugs done. When held the gun got you runnin from a loved one. Thought you was down to die but you been found to lie. So fuck you can't trust you, gotta bust you. Crush you now you can't lick hits and hustle. Try to flex your muscle. But my criteria gotta over comes yo strategies. Try to make a mob out of peas. I can ride on you wit Money-T and an amount of cheese. Plus I had a lot of bud in 'em. I get mad at the budgin' 'em. Whippin out the stud in 'em. But I ain't even studying. If again and it's on I just put a slug in him. Duggin him dead and headin hoes off at the pass. Open up a can of kick ass. Toy wit me loyalty die quick blast. [Maze]. I roll wit straight mobsta leaners. That always carry beamers. And exercising trigger fingers on niggas who come between us. Shockin' the world wit young slingers. And we can't be defeated, even if you triple team us. Cause this game got my mod deranged if you in pain. Kamokaze like my nigga Lo if we loose to you man. So ready to aim cause it ain't shit to explain. Shots to exchange plenty of paper in the game. To help us remain on top of the world until we go bang. Doin our thang while y'all niggas just hate and complain in vain. But it'ws still gonna be the same we gonna mob forever. And out shine all you bitch ass niggas together. [chorus].

"Ryu:. Ryu and Tak, Demigodz. Green Lantern, Scoop DeVille. This kid is only seventeen, man. He’s about to be a problem. Tak:. So let’s get right to it and groove. Ain’t nothin’ but a thing to getcha grippin’ the move. Gotta lovin’ the way we swing when we step on the scene. You know we kill it, goin’ all out, we about to get it. Ryu:. Yo, it’s in my blood, I was born to spit it. The coroner has kept me warm through the storms of winter. Ignored the pain and struggle when it’s time for dinner. We huddle together and grind, rain or shine. Survive the weather, forget about changing spinners. Throw me a bone, I’m just tryin’ to raise my litter. It made me bitter, eventually made me sicker. So when the heat’s on we don’t get pre-game jitters, uh-uh. We go to work man, diggin’ in dirt, we took ‘em to church. We’re checkin’ in some teenage strippers. Livin’ life by the seat of my pants and threepeated, we champs. Undefeated we can’t lose ever whoever wanted with us. Better roll with a camp you trust to cover your ass when your asses can’t. Huh, so bottom’s up, here’s one for the crew. Put some liquor in your gut and tell me what you wanna do, sing it. S, for every sucker left behind. O, what they were yellin’ when I bust a rhyme. B, best believe when it’s time to get it. We grind and jet cause we ain’t got time to kick it. No. S, for the drunk sexy women. O, sippin’ Jack with some Pepsi in it. B, best believe when it’s time to get it. We grind and jet cause we ain’t got time to kick it. Tak:. So let’s get right to it and groove. Ain’t nothin’ but a thing to getcha grippin’ the move. Gotta lovin’ the way we swing when we step on the scene. You know we kill it, goin’ all out, we about to get it. Wow, look at ‘em now, their mouths are closed. We done came a long way since 2004. Spilled “Bleach”, got the whole entire crowd exposed. The fumes leakin’ in the street, throwin’ down them bowls. Whoa, we on the job, the one with the mob. The fake facades to get it just to make new large. I roll a seven to nine just to break the yards. And step in your mind and unfold the great bizarre. Hit the kill switch, yeah, found my hitch. I’m on the pitcher’s mound for now, it’s me and Will Smith. Finally overseas, I sneak in the mattress. Ain’t nothin’ like a sweet club freak with an accent. We out gettin’ bent makin’ dollar amounts. So if you with me let me see you raise your bottom with shots, say it. S, for every sucker left behind. O, what they were yellin’ when I bust a rhyme. B, best believe when it’s time to get it. We grind and jet cause we ain’t got time to kick it. No. S, for the drunk sexy women. O, sippin’ Jack with some Pepsi in it. B, best believe when it’s time to get it.

"Wake me up on the bat (3X). Wake me up on the battle. Waking up on the battlefield. Feels like a gun fire in our eyes. Can’t change the way we feel. It hurts us every time.

With melodies that heal me. This is a sad song. Just sing with me tonight. Just sing with me. Woah oh, woah oh oh (2X). This bed is a battlefield. All along with your memories in my heart. Lie awake and my fate is sealed. You haunt me in the dark. Love you, the death of me. One touch you could make me bleed. Now we fight. While we cry. It’s surrender, do or die. And we don’t know why. CHORUS. This is a sad song. For the long gone. With melodies that heal me. This is a sad song. Just sing with me tonight. Just sing with me. Woah oh, woah oh oh (2X). This is a sad song.

"(Verse). Looking in the mirror. My own reflection. Can't stand to look into my eyes. It's been eating me up. The things we're hiding. I'm so done with those lies. (Verse). Now I've cheated, I've miss-leaded, baby oh oh. Forgot your birthday, it was on Thursday, I am so oh. By the time you got you cryin but you know. I'm only human. (Pre-Hook 1). I did some things that I can't erase. I'm not looking for no one to blame. Think it's time I've told you everything. I'm not who you think. (Hook). Now you know who I really am. Now you know where I've been. I'm only hoping that you'll understand. Sometimes I make…. Mistakes. Mistakes. Mistakes. Sometimes I make mistakes. (Verse). I'm so possessive, overprotecting. Wanna know who what and where. It's ‘cause I love you. But maybe too much. But I'm only human. (Pre-Hook 2). Now you know what you don't see. Only comes from insecurity. I'm not perfect and I'll never be. I'm not who you think. (Hook). Now you know who I really am. Now you know where I've been. I'm only hoping that you'll understand. Sometimes I make…. Mistakes.

Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be. I guess you gotta see it to believe. Oh, I been a fool, but that's cool, that's what human beings do. Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes. Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed. But the sun's coming out now, clouds start to move. Don't tell me nothing but the truth. I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second.

"Yo, yo, yo. This your man Royce Da 5'9"". This your dude Crooked I. Man, Jump off Joe Beezy. Yaowa - It's Joell Ortiz. [Joell Ortiz]. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Joell Ortiz]. Little niggas get your weight up fuck y'all, pay up. My bars just as slick as my dick and both stay up. Nicer than me, say what? Wait up, straight up. I finish niggas right off the bat like a layup. I seen a lot of come, I seen a lot of go. But y'all know where I'm from, B-R double O. You know the rest pimpin', yeah, I was bred different. Here come pops with the NY bop, you know, the leg limpin'. My ice mug frozen till it's stiff. Grimy nigga, might wanna hold onto your bitch. I got a way with women, I faithfully play with women. Let 'em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in 'em. I might just throw on my gold fronts. Pour up a cup of E & J and light up a dro blunt. I was never soft, never saw me flinchin' when they lettin' off. Never had to retaliate cause I set it off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Royce Da 5'9]. Ya'll know my name, bitch, never change up my language. I'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt. First we take oath, then I'm pulling turquoise strings. In my Lebron corks, in Turks and Caicos. I came from wicker chair fame wearin' short sets. I learned that money can't buy happiness. But I decided I'd rather do all my cryin' in the Corvette. Make a dollar, buy a suit. Have a child, and have 'em follow suit. Wavin' that weather change thing. Make the winter fall, coming through with everything to lose. Taking everything from you know. Let him finish his fall in his draws. And pray that he land on that minute hand in my Hublot. I'm about that Art Of War gospel. That Basquiat Picasso drawing a roscoe. Using the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow. Your money on me, bet it all, you know I'mma set it off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Joe Budden]. Let's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth. Truth is I give a fuck, but it's right to myself. Fuck fame, keep the shit I write to myself. If what I do is therapeutic, man, the slightest shit helps. Made angel dust my freshman year. Gave it a try, cool, little did I knew. Had the wrong meaning of high school. Teachers called him a sociopath and a liar. Fuck them, only went to class for the cyphers. Now I'm gettin' bills for. The same thinking they tried to prescribe pills for. They said I needed a wrench, I'm a loose screw. Vital, suicidal, said I would kill me or more. Wasn't speakin' in French, said I'd let it off. Never know who or what you might get. Main reason they never want me to set it off. You now dealing with four niggas that's never off. All bets are off, so nah, you won't be better off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse. [Crooked I]. Jewish tats on my arm like a Semitic boss. Egyptian ankh hanging, that's my Kemetic cross. Slaughterhouse set it off. Even got bitches wavin' our flag, Betsy Ross. Old school Chevy, the head is off. Decapitated Impala. Heavy 'lac from the weight of the llama. Still bear arms like a shaven koala. How you thinkin' like a faded neurology student. Is prudent when chasin' a dollar. So never mind, a clever rhyme. I'd rather find a better grind, forever times. Sittin' behind me because I'm ahead of mine. In this era I'm livin' outside of the paradigm. I'm comin' outside with a pair of dimes. Sharon and Caroline. Share a line then they share a 9 inch, never mind. I probably shouldn't even keep going. Cause these rappers keep hoein' with their teeth showing. I set it off. Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse",Hip Hop,Eminem

[Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. It was like.. whoahh and then the fuckin room started spinnin and shit. And my friend came in he was like, ""Yo! Yo! Em! Em!. You puttin that shit up your nose again?"". And I was like, ""Naw"" nuttin like - everything was just spinnin. I couldn't even see and like, he started to look like a monster n shit. Then I just started laughin and threw up all over the fuckin floor. It's crazy. [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]. It's because, of these drugs, that I do, that make me. do these things, that I do, do these things, that I do. [Eminem]. My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it. It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it. You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it. It's got the power to get you to do it (c'mon). So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off. Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped. So get this song, go run out and buy this disc. And try this shit, as much coke as I just did. Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these. Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed. It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does. and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids. [Bizarre]. Hey Stephanie (hi!) Let's take some ecstasy (okay!). Now pull your pants down bitch and have sex with this dog next to me. (huh?) 'Til I'm dead I'm takin blunts to the head. Needles in my broken leg, listen to Grateful Dead. These mescalines got me sure. that I can fuck any whore with genital warts on the Warped Tour. Who slipped this downer in my Snapple?. Cussin out Interscope (Bizarre, you're signed to Capitol!). Fuck it, I was born with half a brain. Sniffin 'caine, at celebrity basketball games. You motherfuckers think I'm a gimmick. cause I got a Cash Money tattoo and roll with No Limit (UNNNNGGGHHH!). The last time I sniffed blow. I ended up in Denver, Colorado at an Iggy Pop show. Bizarre be smokin a half a pound. Fuckin the engineer's wife, while he's mixin my song down. [Chorus 1]. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. It's like, back when I first went on tour. I like, went crazy I was like out of control. And - just was fuckin wasted every night, like. wakin up the next morning like - where the... Where the fuck am I at, what the fuck is goin on. you see what I'm sayin? I was just like, out of control. [Chorus 2 - over last two lines of Chorus 1]. [Swifty McVay]. These Benadryls got me stiffer than a mannequin. Eight years old swallowin Anacins, standin over my bannister. Laughin with a chromed out caliber (hahahahaha). The weed that I'm sellin this (?) look like the back of a tarantula. I keep a substantial amount of aspirins in my Acura. Smashin it, after framin a nigga with smack and dust. I'm scandalous, drugs been ran for months. Crackin capsules to expand our blunts. I rolled it up and take the pressure to the head. Now I'm lookin like a extra on ""Night of the Living Dead"". until they find me on a stretcher. I'm quick to sample anything, bitch you got a tester?. This crank'll have me blowin up banks like Uncle Fester. [Proof]. Ahhhh.. watch tonight, you'll admit that I'm a fiend. Pop beans, 'scalines, along with amphetamines. Ghetto kings, meddling with the smell of greens. Got a Jell-o spleen, and see yellow rings (ohhhhhh). Blue pills, and purple mushrooms. (Hey little girl, you got a curfew, don't you?). Missin since yesterday, perfect just for rape. See I'm on judgment day, numb from special K. Two tabs of X and vitamin C. Swallow Hennessey along with Tylenol 3. Grindin the teeth at the signs of the E. I lost six days at a time in the week. The crime in the street hold your parents for ransom. while D-12 gang rape Marilyn Manson. In twelve hours we blow a pound of the chronic. Barf up my stomach linin, drown in my vomit. [Chorus 1] - 2.5X. [Eminem - speaking over Chorus 1]. Cause I like, I always tell people - yknowhatI'msayin like. If you got an addiction, don't admit, to nobody, yknowhatI'msayin?. Keep that shit to yourself; because if anybody sees that, yknahmsayin. when you're out in the public eye and shit. they're always gonna think that you're on that shit even if you're not. That's why I always tell my friends, knowhatI'msayin but. I mean, like for me, I don't give a fuck. I'll probably end up, dyin from this shit one day. Probably pick up a newspaper in the morning and it's like. ""Eminem dies from, drug overdose"" - youknowhatI'msayin? And. And my friends, they ain't no fuckin better, yknowhatI'msayin?. They ain't nothin but influences, bad influences to me, y'know. It's peer pressure, shit is like all peer pressure. That's what it boils down to - and, I give in to it. So do they...

"[Verse 1]. It was the summer 2001. All before the drama begun. When we first met. I seen you sitting out on your steps. You was broke down crying a mess. So I interferred. I asked what's the reason for tears. I was wishing you could tell me your fears. But I'll start with ya name. You told me how ya man playin games. So I said that it was time for a change. And you just laughed. But it looked like you aint laughed in while. I was glad that I could give you a smile. Then we both blushed. But really girl it aint no rush. I was thinking maybe that we can discuss. A future for us. Cause homeboy just got you crushed. You need to leave that clown in the dust. Trust. I just wanna talk. I'm thinking I can give you a call. And we can pick it up. Where we left off. I'll holla tomorrow. [Chorus]. Girl I understand you loyal to ya man. And that's alright aww baby. But that dont change the fact. That you fine and you stay crying every night nah baby. Girl you got to let him know. You can't live like this no more. Nah baby. Cant see. Together you and me could be so special ah baby. [Verse 2]. Our feelings get greater. A million days later. Talking all night we stay up but. Here comes ya ex. Returned with that drama and stress. All the nonsense that you just left but yet. You except and go back to try it again. Then return with a broken heart. That I gotta mend. That's unfair. I've only been your lover and friend. Homey there he just front and pretend. But you dont care the life he leads. Is unsafe. I would never place my hands to your face. But still I chase. Cat and mouse. First you kick him out. Then you at his house. What is that about. I cant figure you out. Even your friend said I was better. But you listen to them. Never like uh-uh whatever. So the next time he hurt you again. You already knew where you should've been. And that's with me. [Repeat Chorus]. [Verse 3]. All the times. You 2way telling me. That you miss me. Wanting me to come over and keep you busy. Remember that. Now that you gone. It's been kinda hard. Cant think, cant sleep. Cant do nothing at all. Just tell me why you had to go back. See you aint have to go through that. My baby. You could've been here right by my side. Me and you at the park taking walks outside. But. Instead, I keep on having these dreams. Waiting for my phone to ring.

Can you react when your life's at stake?. I rock the stripes of an M-P, pon my timb tree. and keep the Taurus for my enemies. Whenever he comes in the mist of this Boot Camp Clik. it gets realer so watch Steele serve justice. Thirty-two degrees freeze until. these MC's decide to relieve you of grievin. [Buckshot]. On my way from out of state, I hit my block F-A-P. wit my man Ruck and my man Rock S-T. Jus left my man brown nose. Now we gotta sack of the black for the shows.

Buckshot b-d-b-d and the Evil Dee, we rock fluently. [Chorus x2]. [Ruck]. Mr. McGee don't get me angry (why?). you wouldn't like it when I'm angry. Ill thoughts to the dome start to change me. Rearrange the, way I be kickin, my flavor. Even my neighbours. notice a change in the Ruck-est behaviour. [Tek]. Now you roaches don't even come close or approach this. What I be smokin leave your monkey ass chokin. Straight from yardie like the one Robert Marley. You hardly ever saaw me witout a bag of that bomb weed.

I'm steppin in hotter this year. wit my bredern dry-tear, my cousin wit no fear. so who - wanna come tess Top Dawg. They dig you out the ditch and then they take you to the morgue. [Steele]. Here's Misdemeanor, the crook wit the mouth full. known for bein live and rockin those flava Timbos. Half pass Lincoln, clothes dead and stinkin. Country bwoy got me just zonin and thinkin. Time to start stackin on you crab ass snakes. Gotta move right, cause my rep's at stake. Call up my dawgs thats quick to bust. P.N.C. take it back to the dust. Now I got fo' eyes to watch my back. plus my own two make it a full six-pack. Now we bring the ruckas to wannabee knuckas. Bodyin suckas like I change up my chuckas. [Buckshot]. Don't you know the W-a-r (war). is o-n (on) open to them headz scopin. Hopin they can get a bite, and write what I write. but they don't know the night. keeps me and my Clik air tight (right). all you biters wanna chunk the script. but your quick to take a flick. by my side as you take my hand, givin the fake smile. but I peeped you for awhile. ease off selecta when the B.D. pulled your file. can I pull your card again, the Buck's guardian. is the Arm-a-Leg-Leg-Arm-a-Head. so begin to drop the bombs (Heltah Skeltah). Booyah!. [Rock]. You ask for it, who want beef well here's war. For this I packs twin automatic 4-4's. Kids this aint before don't even speak about my fleet. Many pop junk but front when MC's meet.

"Uh, look. Good evening. Yeah. When I party in New York, take the late night subway. Goin' out Friday to comin' home Monday. From all directions never find me on the one way flavor. The rhyme just the icin' on the cupcake fuck face. My fans notice these other rappers is bogus. I'm Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. And the boy stay, kickin' incredibly dope shit. Make my momma proud cause my clothes fit. Travel round the globe bitch, on my Lewis Clark shit. Don't matter where I live, cause I can tell you where my heart is. I just stay on my side, fuck where everybody at. Tell the planet peace cause I'm gone I ain't comin' back. Had the whole regular life I can tell you that I'm done with that. Try to build a mill off a couple stacks. On my own business, investin' all I got into these fuckin' raps. Willie Parker money, hand it off then it's runnin' back. Ayo you fuck wit dat. Uh you gotta fuck wit dat. You in love wit dat. Look, uh Mac Miller. Takin' sips from the fountain of youth. If you ain't heard about the kid then you out of the loop. As I'm sittin' back starin' at this world in my eyes. See out the window in my room that I've hidden aside. I'm just a kid who stays speakin' his thoughts, talkin' his mind. Like a roller coaster but I stay along for the ride. Put my heart up on the page, and the song gonna cry. It's launchin' behind, the way you stand caught in a lie. Ain't a shock that I'm a topic of discussion. Muthafuckas want my spot so they probably wish I wasn't. They give a little love like everyone does. In reality, they stoned off that competitive drug. And I don't blame em, cause those who above me, I'm gunnin' for. Try and make my way to the top, startin' from the floor. And I don't even need to bring a single gun to war. Cause I be on some shit that they ain't never done before. Takin' over piece by piece, startin' from the core. It's only been a year I can stick around a hundred more. Said I could stick around a hundred more. I ain't goin nowhere. Young and so much time to go. Jerm you might as well keep this one rollin. I got like one more verse I haven't spit three verses in a song in a minute. See if I can remember this one. Light look. You can find me in the lab workin' overtime. Smell the weed when you go and buy global grind. And I ain't just a local guy. When you feelin' stressed out, have an L. Blow money, keep my lady decked out in Chanelle. Live fast when I die better wish me well. Huh, I just hope they servin' beer in hell. Just an everyday story that I'm here to tell. So please, stick around for the Epilogue. For anyone who ever blog, probably heard my name. Hip-Hop's underdog, you wanna win the game. I'm sick of hearin' how music change never be the same. And these dudes who think they everything and never pick a lane. Call yourself a vet, but haven't won a single game. Mad, every girl got my name imprinted in her brain. Boy I'm a beast, match the style in bars. Find me smokin' weed where the wild things are. Yessir. So I mean, I had to take this time. Real quickly, to just go in. I don't know man I feel like you should never stop goin' in on your shit. That's just me. I mean, Qtreezy out there we excited just makin' history. And Jerm of course. Digo Yukio",Hip Hop,Mac Miller
"[Bad Azz]. We confined to these wordly ways, it's unchanging. The money makes, murder the kids, and gangbangin. The stock market crashed, they watchin my black ass. You pop em for fast cash so we dies over dollars. Get wise hold the knowledge, we rides know the choices. The key to the future, the devil he wanna shoot ya. Fuck em they call us niggs I'm tryin to make a livin. Do some touchin, you know I'm pretty good with the bustin. Trustin nothin you can buy if your money in discretion. We'll beat you and car jacks and leave you wit a concussion. We the gang, we mash and blast and maintain. Still the same, just fuckin wit a brand new thang. Bang, bang, take that, nigga 'fore we skirt out. Aint gotta say shit already put the word out. Ya heard how the thang goes down around us. We playas, so haters can't clown around us. On point, big fat blunts and joints. And get drunk, this cold world, they aint givin a fuck. About you livin let alone you livin it up. Niggas is stuck, I'm tryin to keep my head above water. Not stressed about dyin for a quarter in a shorter. My time get the heart of my rhymes, get a nigga get better with time. And wonderin how I'm goin by, can't help it in the heat of the. Heartless hood, it's all good. CHORUS: Snoop Dogg. You's a nigga when you born, a nigga when you dyin. Nigga quit lyin you's a nigga for life. You's a nigga when you ridin, a nigga when you sidin. Nigga quit tryin you's a nigga for life. You can paint your face and change your nose and buy new clothes. But you know what.... You cant change who the fuck you are. You's a motherfucking nigga for life. [Goldie Loc]. It's all sowed up, in the LBC. Bitches breakin bread when they see the lil ass gee. I keeps my finga on the trigga cuz I'm down for this bangin shit. Quick to do it for the cause bitch I smash for my dogs. So don't get close to my nine. Cuz if you do you in store to see your nigga do the crime. Sirens goin off, niggas bowin down. Now you know about to rip gut fools ready to clown. Nigga fuck you bitches, and you hoes and you sluts. You tricks don't know what the fuck's up. On the eastside we ride, nigga 24 / 9. Tryin to keep my hands on somethin nigga at all times. Ready for war now that my pockets got bigger. You other fools die when I ride for my niggas. Cuss, bust, and fuss and kick up dust. What you laughin at nigga don't get your bitch ass rushed. CHORUS. [Tray Deee]. As a child I was wild as fuck, and down to dump. And kept a sawed off brown to pump. And my reputation never takin time to thank. Role models, holdin bottles, as we ride and drink. Livin right and plottin how to come up off the bottom. Black stockings in our pockets and I pocket profits. Fuck a school, I tuck a tool and start steppin. First lesson, aint no question, you gotta have protection. Sheets on the streets showin niggas defeats. And most beef don't cease 'til the trigga release. Livin hard, givin scars, gettin noise from hustlin. Slangin gangbangin run a game in musslin. Trustin nothin, sayin fuck it is the slogan. Everywhere we go we off the chronic and the potion. >From the ocean to the city to the valley to the bay. Niggas on the mission for the cabbage every day. Cutthroats, gunsmoke, dope and hoes. What controls niggas souls on the streets I roll. Bold letters think the gangs where I bang is at. Saints, Cowboys, Steelers and Raider hats. Though I know we all the same no matter what we claim. If you a nigga you a nigga and that aint gon change. We love Martin Luther King but respected Malcolm. Cuz he didn't give a fuck about the outcome. CHORUS 2X.",Hip Hop,Snoop Dogg

"[GZA (RZA)]. I grew up around block parties ready to rock. Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock. The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop. A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks. With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck. And each link in your chain is trucked. No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers. Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper. I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's. Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs. It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout. +Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt. Now his wigs pushed back. Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact. (Yo). [Chorus x2: U-God]. Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+. Got to check out +The W+, got to check out-- +The W+. [Method Man]. MC's have the right to remain silent. Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers. And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya. Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta. It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya. Like red heat with hammers and sickles. I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues. It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us. Then lord strike me down where I stand at now. wit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen. The most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC. Of course it's Tical!. [Chorus]. [U-God]. The Princess, the Pope, incest, dope. Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke. The man not for joke, we all out for broke. Plus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote. You can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton. I'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one. I stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome. +Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+. [Chorus]. [Raekwon]. Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips. Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch. Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs. Sick winter gear, been on position is where. Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+. Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped. Swing through the hood calmly. Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George. Dust shut shit off, whips spin off. Get off, slips, which, wiz. Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines. Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies. Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine. Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines. [Chorus]",Hip Hop,Wu-Tang Clan
"Diddy:]. Last night. I couldn't even get an answer. Tried to call. But my pride wouldn't let me dial. And I'm sitting here. With this blank expression. And the way I feel. I wanna curl up like a child. [Pharrell:]. Yessir, yo, yo, uh, ah-uh, ah-uh. (This is the remix). Picture the song. Picture my life and my intention to ball. Picture the sights and how it glitter for y'all. Now don't you feel ""close to perfect"" when a chick is involved. She changed you life, and your frame of mind. Sorry, I hope what I'm sayin is fine. We fuss but we take it one day at a time. If there's a fire you know that she'd lay in the line. And I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth. Open my mind and words come out. You're eclectic, you're creative. You the picture, girl, I just painted. I gotta get it and its all paid for. Big castle on the seashore. With the wind, the walk, and decor. How this sound, mister and missus skateboard?. P. [Keyshia:]. If I told you once, I told you twice. You can see it in my eyes. I'm all cried out. With nothing to say. You're everything I wanted to be. If you could only see. Your heart belongs to me. I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch. Come and set me free. Forever yours I'll be. Baby won't you come and take this pain away. [Diddy:]. Last night. I couldn't even get an answer. Tried to call. But my pride wouldn't let me dial. And I'm sitting here. With this blank expression. And the way I feel. I wanna curl up like a child. [T. I. :]. Let me get you where I want you, your best nightgown. Yeah I had a lotta women, you the best I've found. If I offered you the chance you'd neglect like how?. With my hands like damn and my neck like wow. Lebanese, puerto rican, like brown. Said they heard I'm the king, wanna test my crown. Swerve on things with the 'Vette top down. I'm the realest, one the dealest to ever rep my town. So if you ever wanna get it off your chest I'm down. How fly does a G5 jet ride sound. Triple black ""fan'll switch"" your S5 down. Now your girl wanna talk about sex right now. Trying to hate them other rappers who respect my style. How I kiss her on the legs while I undress, lie down. I wanna see you with your hair let down. And your body soaking wet on the bed, stretched out. T. I. P. [Keyshia:]. I need you. And you need me. This is so plain to see. And I will never let you go and. I will always love you so. I will. If you could only see. Your heart belongs to me. I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch. Come and set me free. Forever yours I'll be. Baby won't you come and take this pain away. [Diddy:]. Last night. I couldn't even get an answer. Tried to call. But my pride wouldn't let me dial. And I'm sitting here. With this blank expression. And the way I feel. I wanna curl up like a child. [Keyshia:]. Why don't you pick the phone. And dial up my number. And call me a baby.

"Look, look, look. A young nigga screaming fuck the world and let 'em die. Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smoking rie. Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet. And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat. I'm tryna' stay under intoxication. 'Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation. I'm drinking liquor like it's water, getting pissy drunk. And staying away from them lil' broads that trying to give me some. I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline. Ducking the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time. Sometimes I just wish I could be away. But I gotta take care of Reginae and keep macita straight. So I just maintain the struggle and I keep trying. But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'. I ain't lying that the law tryna' bust my clique. But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this. [Hook 2x]. Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world. I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl. And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real. And I'm still doing for my mother and I'm payin' bills. Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad. The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at. And my old lady say she saw me with anotha Brizzah. And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em. And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse. And now she tripping talking 'bout I need to be in church. And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court. Tryna' put me, a child, on child support. And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'. Plus, my niggas keep falling to them drugs and stuff. That dope got these niggas melting away. Man they got clowns right around me, killing they self everyday. We keep fighting but they so strong. I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on. Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust. And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck. We don't give a fuck. [Hook]. I mean the world just ain't gon' never change. So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang. Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas. Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug. Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?. But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit. That's why this lil' nigga be bugging like it's no tomorrow. I only can depend on macita and C-M-R. I try my best to make it through the night and live today. But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away. And police got me under surveillance when and wherever. Wrecking they brains, tryna' figure where I'm getting that cheddar. I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone. I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown. But I try to forget about it and just stand strong. But if everything was cool I wouldn't write this damn song. Fuck the world. [Hook 3x]",Hip Hop,Birdman

"[Chorus - T.I. and Pharrell]. (But she's a freak though). She got angel eyes, wit the baby face. (But she's a freak though). I want my momma and daddy to meet her. Maybe have my baby. (But she's a freak though). They keep talking about you. Because they - can't keep up with your pace. You're my - super freak! super freak!. You're my - super freak!. [Verse - T.I.]. My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest. And everything that shine ain't a diamond. They say that change come wit time and I'm finding. That most bitches take your kindness for blindness. Yeah it feel good laying her beside you. Diggin deep, all nine up inside you. But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you. Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you. It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife. Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife. They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right. Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight. A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice. Juicy ass that them niggaz in the south like. She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife. Wearing all white, being wit her for life. [Chorus]. [Verse - T.I.]. The main thing making niggaz judge you. Is the same thing that make me wanna love you. From the smell of ya hair, I wanna hug you. To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you. Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin. That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships I was in. But my partna say you trickin wit his cousin. But nevermind, I don't listen they be buggin. They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love. This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs. Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls. And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls. They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls. Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl. Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl. Make me wanna bring another kid in the world. [Chorus]. [Verse - T.I.]. Now I been told every nigga in the streets know. She ain't nothing but a freak ho. But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though. Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before. But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know. All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though. I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?. Just try me bout her folk, that's what I'm toting heaters for. I'd die by that for her a real good reason though. That's how I feel, let my partnaz and my momma know. Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go. I just respect that she herself and she don't hide it. Though she may have been a tad misguided. All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction. A nigga wit a constant erection. And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing. Procrastinating, I wanna buy a ring and pop the question. [Chorus]",Hip Hop,T.I.

I found the love from him don't feel right. Kinda felt like thunder, kinda felt like rain. Kinda felt like him and the storm was the same. I ain't ever been the same since.

Let me hold you. For the last time. It's the last chance to feel again. But you broke me. Now I can't feel anything. When I love you. Rings so untrue. I can't even convince myself. When I'm speaking. It's the voice of someone else. Oh it tears me up. I tried to hold on but it hurts too much. I tried to forgive but it's not enough. To make it all okay. You can't play on broken strings. You can't feel anything. That your heart don't want to feel. I can't tell you something that ain't real. Oh the truth hurts. And lies worse. How can I give anymore. And I love you a little less than before. Oh what are we doing. We are turning into dust. Playing house in the ruins of us. Running back through the fire. When there's nothing left to say. It's like chasing the very last train. When it's too late. Oh it tears me up. I tried to hold on but it hurts too much. I tried to forgive but it's not enough. To make it all okay. You can't play on broken strings. You can't feel anything. That your heart don't want to feel. I can't tell you something that ain't real. Oh the truth hurts. And lies worse. How can I give anymore. And I love you a little less than before. But we're running through the fire. When there's nothing left to say. It's like chasing the very last train. When we both know it's too late. You can't play on broken strings. You can't feel anything. That your heart don't want to feel. I can't tell you something that ain't real. Oh the truth hurts. And lies worse. How can I give anymore. And I love you a little less than before. Oh and I love you a little less than before. Let me hold you for the last time. It's the last chance to feel again,Hip Hop,Nelly Furtado

"Desperate. [Verse 1: Lecrae]. Woke up this morning too depressed and shamed to leave my bed. Cant stand to see my own reflection so I hang my head. Feel like a disappointment like scum of the earth. I'm so hurt I know you see I cant cover my dirt. My soul's dying hearts weak and I cant even cry. I'm sposed to run to you but WHY I'm such an evil guy. The sun's shining but for me it's the darkest of days. Try to pretend it never happened but the guilt remains. I leave the house it feels like everybody knows I did it. Feel like they reading my mind and know the sin I committed. Through your blood I'm aquitted but my heart doesnt get it. Oh God I'm desperate for help cause I'm grieving your spirit. I couldnt sing in the sunday service, Lord I felt fake. and when they started communion I just made an escape. I'm in need of your grace feels like you hid your face. Lord lead me back to cross and show me my sins erased. [2x Chorus: Cam]. I'm so desperate,. I can't believe I've sinned against you. Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry). Your mercy is what I need. [Verse 2: Lecrae]. I'm waste deep in my pity is Satan tryna trick me. And tell me you wont forgive me cause it's startin to get me. Jesus help me quickly I hate the wrong I've done. I know we all fall but I feel like the only one. Feels like I should be shunned I punish myself. I know it's dumb cause by your death all my sin has been dealt. But my sin is been felt I didn't want to it. But what I want to do I don't I swear I'n goin through it. I'm tryne open up my bible need to read your pages. Need you Lord but my guilt has got me feeling so faithless. Help me see where grace is take me back to the basics. Help me find my joy in you and not people and places. My sin is ever before me I turned my back on you. Oh father break and restore me to bring me back to you. My sin is ever before me I turned my back on you. God break and restore me to bring me back to you. . [2x Chorus: Cam]. I'm so desperate,. I can't believe I've sinned against you. Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry). Your mercy is what I need. [Verse 3: Lecrae]. Have mercy on me God according to your steady love. Wipe away my transgressions and wash me in your blood. Create in me clean heart renew a right spirit. Don't hide your face from me God your Presence keep me near it. I'm waiting patience on you Lord I know you hear my cry. Restore your Joy in me for you alone I live and die. It's you I glorify cause you don't want my sacrifice. You want me broken and contrite trusting in the Christ. I confess to you my sin and you show me mercy. I turn away from it demonstrating that you are worthy. Over lust, over pride, over all sin. Is my affection for Jesus who died for all them. I was lost now i'm found i was toss to the ground. My sin weighed on me heavy but I am no longer bound. As sure as Christ wear the crown I know that grace will abound. And even when I feel lost I know in you I am found. . [2x Chorus: Cam]. I'm so desperate,. I can't believe I've sinned against you. Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry).

More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger. I'm a bad motherfucker and you know this. But the pussy ass niggaz don't show this. But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps. If not from the records, from jackin the crops. Just like burglary, the definition is 'jackin'. And when illegally armed it's called 'packin'. Shoot a motherfucker in a minute. I find a good piece o' pussy, I go up in it. So if you're at a show in the front row. I'm a call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho. You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to. But that shows me, slut, you're composed to. a crazy muthafucker from tha street. Attitude legit cause I'm tearin up shit. MC Ren controls the automatic. For any dumb muthafucker that starts static. Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself. every time I pull a AK off the shelf. The security is maximum and that's a law. R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw. See, coz I'm the motherfuckin villain. The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin. that's takin place without a clue. And once you're on the scope, your ass is through. Look, you might take it as a trip. but a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip. Straight outta Compton.... Refrão:. [City of Compton, City of Compton]. [Dr. Dre] Eazy is his name and the boy is comin.... Verse Three: Eazy-E. ...straight outta Compton. is a brotha that'll smother yo' mother. and make ya sister think I love her. Dangerous motherfucker raises hell. And if I ever get caught I make bail. See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem. I see a motherfuckin cop I don't dodge him. But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while. And when I see a punk pass, I smile. To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showin a nigga drivin. but don't know where the fuck he's going, just rollin. lookin for the one they call Eazy. But here's a flash, they never seize me. Ruthless! Never seen like a shadow in the dark. except when I unload, see I'll get over the hesitation. and hear the scream of the one who got the last penetration. Give a little gust of wind and I'm jettin. But leave a memory no one'll be forgettin. So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!. You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker!. This is the autobiography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me. You'll get taken by a stupid dope brotha who will smother. word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton. Refrão:. [City of Compton, City of Compton]. [Damn that shit was dope!]",Hip Hop,Ice Cube
I was just walking out school. I saw this girl gettin off the train. We exchanged numbas and went on a couple dates. At first everything was cool. Until i meet her sista laren. Got introduced to each other and then everything. changed. I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit. But my homies said to stay away. But I'm 17 what you expect me to do. I guess we'll charge it as a part of the date. If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right. I kissed your sister last night. It ain't my fault. I guess your sister's my type. If I'm wrong oh I don't want to be right. I kissed your sister last night. It ain't my fault. I guess your sister's my type. Now I'm on the telephone talking. With laren but her sisters on the other line. But i can't help my self Cuz laren too fine. And I know this may be wrong but it feels so right. Her sister is nice but laren is more like sugar and. spice. [Bridge]. I wanted a piece of that forbidden fruit. But my homies said to stay away. But I'm 17 what you expect me to do.

"Metro. We done came up dog and never look down. I might gotta throw my Jesus chain on for this. When you put the work in man it shows. Straight up out the ashes then I rose. I done hit a all time low. Been at a stand-still and had to go go go. Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la. Breaking promises you need like na na na. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. Everything automatic so I can't waste time. And if we break up I only make up time. My team do this shit easier than lay-up lines. Never scared to cross that line or pay up fines. Look, Don Don Don, that's my top 3 in the order. Never took a shortcut. Meet a Crip off the late back. Y'all look like a short club. Shoutout to my loyal ones, I wish that it was more of us. Went from 30, 000 a year to 30, 000 feet as my floor plan. I got El Chapo with a choppa as my doorman. I'm on the other side taking care of what's important. If business not boomin' then it's time to change the format. Time to change the recipe, I'm special especially. Going for the record, no felony. And I'm dodging jail and jealousy. Day dreaming about a cruise with Penelope. Looking like success fell on me (damn). And get rid of all that jealousy. All that hate in your heart. I ain't got no enemies. I'm focused on what's meant for me. Putting my energy back into me, real shit. When you put the work in man it shows. Straight up out the ashes then I rose. I done hit a all time low. Been at a stand-still had to go go go. Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la. Breaking promises you need like na na na. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. Boy this shit intricate. Working like a machine. they keep trying to throw a wrench in it. But I'm too intuitive and into it. No ghostwriting, no sixth sensing it. That's why all this shit sound so intimate. That's why I feel like you know me before we face to face. As for the latest, I'm the greatest Ali Bomaye. I put that work in overnight like that shit due today. I paint the pictures they can't trace, try and you get erased. I'm less focused on props and more on property. They put so much back on my hood. that I changed the economy. I'm 'bout to build a movie deal to downtown properly. And help revive the heart of the city. just keep on watching me. And if these bitch ass niggas got they wish and stopping me. Just know I done done so much good business in my life. That there's gon' always be a job for me, a op for me. I never burned bridges so there's a hundred ways. to get where I gotta be, Don. Same people, you see on the way up. Same ones you gonna see on the way down. You feel me?. You love me, I love you. You hate me, I love you, straight up. When you put the work in man it shows. Straight up out the ashes then I rose. I done hit a all time low. Been at a stand-still had to go go go. Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la. Breaking promises you need like na na na. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya. No hearts, no love, no kumbaya",Hip Hop,Big Sean

I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas. Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'ma bust him. Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewlery. Get you niggaz popped quick, filled full of hot shit. Fresh out the box Tip hot than a drop 6. Made a quarter mil' in the penn givin' stock tips. Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip. Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip. You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip. Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip. Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat. 5 carrat stones with the platinum all up under dat. Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of dat.

I know alota rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me. Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?. Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly. But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me. How many rappers you know that could hold they own on White street. East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly. Normal population, half the jail just like me. Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me. Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely. They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'for they bite me. They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be. Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey. My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey. Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly. Fiesty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me. I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely. [Hook]. (Asap asap asap...). A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow him off the map A-S-A-P. Ask anbody who runnin' a G, bet they finna say me A-S-A-P. Niggaz hatin' on P.S.C. get straightened A-S-A-P. A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow him off the map A-S-A-P. [Verse 3]. Flip, say who known to the land and the people. My plan is to keep you atleast 2, levels under me where I need you. I'ma take advantage of my chance to defeat you. Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you. I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal. You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you. Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to. The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you. Seen on the scene white tees and the v-suits. O.G. status, Ion't beef unless I need to. Sissy you way outa line and you runnin' outa time. Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time. Yeah I know you were thinkin' outa sight and outa mind. But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryna shine. Listen nigga this shit here is more than just alota rhymes. Ion't know what ya do for your respect, but I'ma die for mine. [Hook]. (Asap asap asap...). A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow him off the map A-S-A-P.

I'm the mother fuckin' queen? Lizabeth. Meetings with the president of every network. That is what the fuck I call? how to network'. My net worth; that net works. Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the nets work. Chillin' with executives. Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive. Trillion dollar deficit. But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit. Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow. I have both and an empire also. Sell out shows out in Norway, Orslo. This is the Re-Up better cop it while it costs low. Flows sick; I'll slap a patient. I'm checkin' these bitches like a application. Cause these bitches trippin' no navigation. So its off with your head; decapitation. Send them up up in flames like a fireman. I do the hiring and I do the firin'. That boss shit that you talk; I live it. And I've callin' the travel if you don't stay on your pivot. Bitch it. We are going up in flames. One more night for us to burn brighter. We are going up in flames. One last time for us to go highe. We are going up in flames. One more night for us to burn brighter. We are going up in flames. One last time for us to go higher",Hip Hop,Gucci Mane
"[Intro]. Let um feel the beat first. I'm bout to come through your stereo. Should I rhyme or start with the hook?. Start with the hook. To my people who don't wanna go to work. Thank God it's Friday. Cover me she bout to put up her skirt. Thank God it's Friday. Do Your mom now you act so berserk. Thank God it's Friday. What's the track, what's the track girl?. She don't wanna, she don't wanna work on Monday. (I wanna thank my hood). [Verse 1]. For makin me a star before I had fast cars. And couldn't tell the difference between Whoppers and caviar. Before the fame. Way before things changed. All I wanted to do was freestyle and get a name. I used to work at the fast food restaurant. For minimum wage. Dreamin I'm on stage. At 17 I left the house. Cause my father was a minister. And I didn't want the Marvin route. What's goin on?. Today to sell a song you need a video with soft porn. MC's in the industry. You wanna tip?. Don't let them pimp you like Goldy. And tell Sony they better have my money. Cause I play wit the Comodores and be like Lionel Richie. Low Income, I stay so hungry that if 50 Cent came to rob me. He'd be part of my charity. (I wanna thank my hood). [Chorus]. To my people cuttin hair in the shops. Thank God it's Friday. To the thugs sweatin up in the chop shops. Yo, it's Friday. To my people that don't got no job. Everyday it's Friday. What's the track, what's the track yo?. She don't wanna, she don't wanna work on Monday. All the Ladies sing. [Ladies]. I don't feel. Like cookin you no breakfast. This mornin. (Wyclef: All my hoodlums say). [Guys]. Well, you don't have. to cook me breakfast. Cause your girlfriend will. After you leave. (I wanna thank my hood). [Verse 2]. For the love of money. I know kids who'll slit your throat. Friday the 13th. Jason wit a trench coat. But you can't scare Suzie. Cause her man got so many uzi's you'd think he was Cadivi. Meanwhile, she's getting her nails done. Crystal clear so they could shine like wit diamonds. It's such a shame what happened last week. Man they found her under the sheets with a letter from the Son of Sam. It said to tell New York I ain't sleepin. You want to be clubbin then you better pack your heat in. And to my man G Swar Rest in Piece. I still poor liquor. 1 draw on the cocoa leaf. Inhale, exhale smoke grasses. Polices in the area, but ain't no need to panic. You wit Wyclef you getting in. If not, then we gonna make CNN. (I wanna thank my hood). To my people who don't wanna go to work. Thank God it's Friday. Cover me she bout to put up her skirt. Thank God it's Friday. Do your mom know you act so berserk?. Thank God it's Friday. What's the track, what's the track girl?. She don't wanna she don't wanna work on Monday. Yo, to my people cuttin here in the shops. Thank God it's Friday. To the thugs sweatin up in the chop shops. Yo, it's Friday. To my people who don't got no job. Everyday it's Friday. What's the track, what's the track yo?. She don't wanna she don't wanna work on Monday. All the Ladies sing. [Ladies]. I don't feel. Like cookin you no breakfast. This mornin. (Wyclef: All my hoodlums say). [Guys]. Well, you don't have. to cook me breakfast. Cause your girlfriend will. After you leave. [Guitar Solo].

"Worst part about fighting with yourself. Is that even if you win, you loose. Can't place the blame on everybody else. So I'm fighting with myself over you. I should have played it different but I didn't know. I never pictured you without me or you letting go. I should have seen it coming. I should have thought it through. The best part of me has always been you. And no apology can bring you back to me. Feels like I'm suffocating, you are the air I'm breathing out. I'm so down and can't move and I'm beating me up over you. The worst part about fighting with yourself. Is that even if you win, you lose, yeah. Can't place the blame on everybody else. So I'm fighting with myself over you. Maybe it's better making you feel you were crazy. Instead of just being the man to fight it. And can't blame, you knew that I was cheating. And I knew that you knew. But when you call me on it. I just turned around on you. Begging you don't let go. [?] confusion, confusing you of not trusting me. All I'm doing wrong, so I sit around fighting myself all day long.",Hip Hop,Ne-yo

She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her. And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain. Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane. And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide. Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide. I cross my heart and hope to die. If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide. Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive. Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes. And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies. Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive. Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke. Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost. Amen!. [Hook]. My Phantom so mean like.

Cause signing work only if buying. pressure was high as shit. 'Member when I first got hit. I seen the iron spit. 50 cash bend in one corner bleeding where pellet hit. My man Shawnny Hill doing strong. Slug burnt through his lower back side. Cracked his spine exit his arm. Lost him twice on the hospital table. And when he died I cried my eyes out. I couldn't take it (damn damn). But the same things continued to happen. Niggaz got bust. I'm a kid with a grown man's mind turning corrupt. Playing innocent infront of my elders. I was running with them cats that be robbing to awkward (man tell 'em). If my name was up in any type trouble. My moms would tell me. Just like you brothers into some shit go get a job or something. Just a little bum on the street. Not working hard for nottin'. Scratch I made whenever pumping. I'm here to offer something. Making sure the crib stay tight. For real I weren't no dummy. Simmy where you gettin' this money. I wash a car be lying. Saying anything 'sides drugs selling. My sister seen me on the block. Transact with fiends saying I'ma tell it.

Or either found dead. Sound said incarcerated just turned a new dad. Remembering them long ten months from slengin'crack bags. Mom put me out with the quickness. Carry your black ass. I'm still coming back to the crib. Oh so you back here. Ma I jut came to holler to see how you doing. Nothing's changed after all these years. Still hustle for some gear.

Raised in project apartments, with no front yard. Had to share their clothes and shoes with cousins and brothers. Never had they own shit, they had to share it with others. I wasn`t born with a silver-spoon sticking out my grill. I was raised in the middle of the struggle on the real. Had some hard times in my life, trying to make ends meet. Not to mention, trying not to fall victim to the streets. Against the odds, a nigga made it out the game. But that don`t mean that. I`m gunna forget about from where I came. UGK ain`t just a name; it`s what a nigga is. I was there before I got in the biz, and nigga that`s on the rizz. [Hook]. [Bun B]. Now people always be around when you shining and balling. But they real hard to find when tough times come calling. You got money, doing good, and they be all in your face. Then disappear like Sue Storm soon as you catch a case. It`s like clockwork homeboy, the shit never fails. Soon as they think the party`s over, everybody bails. Could a sworn they was your friends when your world was on shine. But soon as you get some time, outta sight, outta mind. It`s a shame that some real ass niggaz took a fall. It`s a shame how they treat you. when you locked behind the wall. When your woman won`t visit and your homie. won`t send you no flicks. Or come and see you, that`s some cold ass shit. Well I miss my nigga, he was down for me. That`s why I got the whole world screaming Free Pimp C. And I`ll be right here waiting when you touch back down. UGK we still holding the crown, kings of the underground. [Hook - Repeat 2X].

"[Verse 1]. Okay, so you just. Go around breaking hearts. Just to see what is inside. Go around stealing em, feeding em to your pride. Did you ever stop and think that. I might really need that. To stay alive?. I'm starting to believe that. You don't really see that. I had given you my life, oh yeah. [Pre-Chorus]. But it's okay, I'm going to find my way.

Mr. Conditional Lover. I wish your father would've stayed. I wish you never promised things. That never did come true. [Pre-Chorus-Variation]. But its okay you're bound to find a way. Cause it will all come back around one day. If you don't learn you'll never know a good thing. You'll never know a good thing. [Chorus]. [Verse 3]. It's okay, you just don't know no better. You're better off being alone. Hope you find comfort. In all of the lies that you told. You'll never get it, I get it. I'm here on my own. I'll be on my own. [Pre-Chorus-Variation]. But it's okay, I'm going to find my way. But as for you, I cannot say the same. If you don't learn, you'll never know a good thing. You'll never know a good thing",Hip Hop,Jhene Aiko
"[Intro: Pimp C]. Little over a year ago I was in bondage. And now I'm back out here reaping the blessings. And getting the benefits that go along with it. Everything that's out here for kings like us. The reason why we like this this jewelry. And this diamonds and stuff. They don't understand is because we really from Africa. And that's where all this stuff come from. And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying. So don't look down on the youngsters. Because they wanna have shiny things.

But we the Black mob, we gonna set it. Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach. 200 in the dash we gonna rev it (skirt). Lucky Luciano is what they call me, paesano. A 100 keys at the piano plays across the Verrazano. El Padrino, in the villa in Venice sipping vino. Not bad for a mulignano, y'all know like we know, I got it. [Hook]. Fuck with me, you know I got it. Fuck with me, you know I got it. Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it. Come fuck with me, you know I got it. [Outro: Rick Ross]. I'm riding big coming down that beach.

"Let's go... (uh). The ones we love. The ones we've lost. There's some we frame. And there's the ones we crop. When all my favorite ones were ruined by my ugly dog. But mum and daddy's wedding days are the most lovely shot. I had a 1000 free minutes till they cut me off. Talking to this chick that used to love me (uh). She used to send me lovely pictures of her lovely (uh). Now they are even bigger and they're bustier. Ha wow. I used to wonder at the stars a lot. Sitting in my dads old barber shop. I used to pull faces when he past the mop. Then he gave me his plate and glass to wash. He made me wanna be the man in charge, the boss.. That's how he got his first grey. But he laughed it off. The moments and memories we keep. Will be forever stored in my micro SD. Back in the day. When I was young. Those were the days. Wish that I could go back. I wanna take you back. To the very moment when you take a snap. Back in the day. To little me. Reminiscing all, all the memories that. Made me happy and they made me sad. All the very moments when you take a snap. Second year of college on the fourth day. That's when I see you standing in the hallway. (Uh) Leonardo Da Vinci portrait. She had a face that I could be looking at all day. Do your shades, small ways. God put a lot of body in a tall frame. I got all fazed. She was pure. I took up literature just to get to know her more. She said she liked immature when she was immature. Shy girl, she could of worked on her image more. (Uh) she made me laugh till my ribs were sore. We were for better for worse. We were for rich for poor. I was tidying my room. When my sister saw. And said T why you still got her picture for. These moments and memories we keep. Will be forever stored in my micro SD. Woo.. Back in the day. When I was young. Those were the days. Wish that I could go back. I wanna take you back. To the very moment when you take a snap. Back in the day. To little me. Reminiscing all, all the memories that. Made me happy and they made me sad.

Times have changed now. I've changed, a good difference. More champagne now. What I'm seeing, for the world I wouldn't miss it. Go far beyond my hopes to go. Fly, you got places to be, can't let the time speed by. Times have changed now. I'm strong, a good difference. More champagne now. What I'm seeing, for the world I wouldn't miss it",Hip Hop,Kid Cudi

"[Intro: Raekwon]. Yo, yo, yo, what up kid? Yo, these niggaz is back, son. (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga. Yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man. You hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is. It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what. [Raekwon]. Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants. The new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent. Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar. This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up. Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes. We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast. Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp. Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps. Back to the dormatory, where niggas. Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory. True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade. So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad. Now it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't. It's blood in my eye, I might get amped. To rip something down, the billboard holders is back. So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down. [GZA]. From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother. And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors. Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it. The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it. It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion. That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned. Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork. Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt. Check the total amount of MC's inflicted. With torture, from moving with work that's restricted. We criticize producers til they joints are right. Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light. Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions. With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen. Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old. Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano. [RZA]. Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers. Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers. Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German. Duck low behind the car, my tech burning. Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight. Absorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like. Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?. Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings. This is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto. The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro. Plus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple. Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle. Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline. Plump breasts, was filled with saline. Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine. Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team. [Masta Killa]. Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?. Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?. I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets. He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding. Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus. Can't quote this, chat with the sword tongue. Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum. Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit. Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room. Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker. Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener. Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel. Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional. To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in",Hip Hop,Wu-Tang Clan

"Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 1. See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her. The name of my record company, she said ""You a sanga"". My name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer. Oh, you that guy they talkin about when they be whisperin aint ya. Bring ya name up when they talkin and say money will change ya. I heard a lot about how you can't deal witchya anger. Heard the rumors bout how you always in trouble or danger. Not gonna judge you if it's true so there's no need to explain. Cause ya do have a right to be, ya seem like ya nice ta me. I'm bout to order me another drink, here, would you like a seat?(Yea). I tell the bartender send Hennesey on ice for me. Her drink starts emptyin while she spillin out her life to me. Tellin me about her goasl and how successful she would like to be. Invitin me, into a session of her life and she. Seems so damn innocent, but something isn't right to me. She pulls out a picture phone ""I got pics, would you like to see?"". I'm thinkin she gotta be friendly as hell. Givin her soul to me, it's like an identity sale. We never met is the story that my memory tells. Tellin me tales like she doesn't handle Hennesey well. Gettin into it, gettin intimate, and into detail. See I just met ya and ya showin me ya kids. Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids. Then who is in this picture?. Man, lemme show you just who it is. Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 2. Um, I don't remember her name, but she looked like a angel. Knew she wasn't from here, I knew that she didn't hanga. Round the same part of the hood, but hey the story gets stranga. Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain ya. See, said she wasn't married, but the ring on her finger. Told me that she was lyin and just usin the same ah. Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her. Spittin the game I spit to em when I'm tryin to bang a. I walked into this guy and he told me he used to know you. He told me about the loyalty and the love he used to show you. He said what he said with a passion like it was so true. And took advantage of the fact that the listeners really didn't know you. His picture's in my pocket book, almost got it, I'll show you. Sheee digs in her purse and while she fumbles around. To find that photo I'm like oh no, there's some trouble in town. We turn around and see two officers comin in now. They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down. So close I could see they barrels of they guns to the ground. So close that they could listen to either one of us now (shhhh). We turn back around and then she says ""No need for whisperin"". Then she tells me ""I don't really give a damn who's listenin"". Tried to make it last a long time was my mission. And he kept on trippin and then I got pissed at him. Hit him with my fist and them punches were never missin him. Chours. i dont know who you are. but you seem very nice. so will you talk to me. shall i tell u a story. shall i tell you a truth. they think i'm crazy. they don't know our life is near. Verse 3. Okay, let's get this straight. Your man cheated on you and now. You're talkin to a perfect stranger like it's makin ya proud. And the rest of this conversation she's just tellin me how. Wasn't her boyfriend in the pic, but a familiar smile. She said pictures can be decieving like she knew he was foul. Look closely and you'll see a coward who uses his smile as power. Gleamin smoke screen, couldn't stand it another hour. So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower. What're you sayin? What do you mean?. I couldn't tell you that I'm missin him. I don't understand what you're sayin. How'd you get rid of him?. She dissin him as I ask her what it is she did to him. She stops and I say ""Eh, keep talkin I'm listenin"". I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturin. Henny spillin and she tell me for real. That the feelin that I was feelin. Was that I wanted to kill him. Somethin is wrong here. And I know just who's the villian. Her voice was gettin louder, the moral is gettin clearer. The officers lookin at us, and I can tell they can hear her. Told me it was protection, reached for it in the stash. The plastic is what she grabbed and she put right on his ass. Busted before the blast, she thought she was free at last. ""Baby I think you crazy. I'm sorry, I'm pressin. for time. I gotta go grind,. times been interestin"". Now I sweatin, I'm stressin, this girl got me guessin. That this conversation is some type of evil confession. She pulls a clearer picture it's my damn best ex-friend. ""How you know him?"". She told me that she was wit em at his house watchin movies. Sundays is when they be chillin. And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him. The feelin was the worse feelin she possibly could be feelin. Stood up, and then I yelled out ""Why the hell did you kill him?"". I didn't kill him I have AIDS. She had sex with em. And that's crazy",Hip Hop,Chamillionaire

Put a bullet in my head take my life and let me die if I ain't fire. Cut me up feed me to the roaches, let me rot if I don't rock. Let me go to hell, burn, sizzle and simmer if I don't deliver. Pull my hair out if I sell out. Bury me on my stomach without no drawers on at all if I don't go off. Or either lethal injection or straight electricity. Let the garbage man pick me up and get rid of me. if I lose creativity. Let me get forced into sexual activity. Let me get turned out by three skank freaks if I don't bust to. the utmost of my ability. Take my head if I say it and don't feel it. Stop selling my record, give me the money back nigga. if I don't sell at least a million. Cut my dick off if I get down and don't get off. Crush my spine and cave my chest in if I come (.?.). If I ain't bad for my age and kick ass for my size. Close my fuckin eyes if you can stop me from sayin or keep me from playin. [Chorus] X 16. [Verse 2]. Snap my pencil, dislocate my fingers and jam my thumb. I ain't gon' write no more, tear my papers, strip clothes if. it don't ship gold. Take my blessed, Baptist Holy Ghost Christian soul. If it take less than a year of playin my records and tapes. before they can say my shit old. If it don't bang, take me out the game, call me out my name. Put me out my house, beat me out my change. Let em read my poem and tell em to seal my doom. When I'm dead read bitch ass nigga in the ground. written across my tomb. Let the breeze take my leaves if my trees don't bloom. Put me in the sun and cut my air supply. if I give these niggas breathin room. If what I'm brewin ain't potent. If what I'm doin ain't rollin. Nigga, diss me, make a movie, talk about it on Oprah. Erase my fuckin vocals, burn my fuckin notebooks. Take my fuckin tank from me and give it back to Goldman. I quit, my career's over. Turn me upside down and hang me from my scrotum. Da da da daah. MC's!. Da da da daah. Da da da daah. MC's!. Da da da daah. [Chorus] X 8. [Verse 3]. Give me my post office application if I ain't hear from rap. Nothin if they ass ain't shake and they hands ain't clap. Take my happiness if it just so happens I ain't happenin. Let something happen to me if I ain't hardcore at it maximum. Flip the dial change the channel if I can't handle. Forget me if I leave this bitch. before I put my fuckin Grammy on the mantle. Let my next fifty concerts get cancelled. If I'm scared in front the camera. Then take my fuckin talent, take me from my family. Sneak me, fuck over me if I don't represent Louisiana. Jump my fence if I ain't the prince. Bitch keep me back if I can't keep up with the presidents. If I don't run circles around these other rap guys. Let my momma Benz catch four flat tires. [Chorus till fade].

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my ass whipped. Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished. I just can't get past these little pissants. That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad. And they so mad they can't stand it. Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk). And they can't handle it like a man. And that's when it just happens. And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't crap is it?. Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit. Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion. Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin. Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now. But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic. Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it. Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me. You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit B. These words stick to you like crazy glue. When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!. I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone. Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!). I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an. Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in the mornin.

Its in the media pitted me of a beef starter. In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one. Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun. Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run. The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious. In a house full of dog shit,. I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin. You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin. It ain't about what you readin. When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins. Either that or we'll be beefin free when. You niggaz need a 'E' just to speak shit!. Your leader is a botique bitch. Keep the heater where you can reach quick. I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret. Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient. When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan. You brave?. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an. Kick your shoes off motherfuckers come on an. Cause we get it on an till the break of dawn an. Wake your ass up motherfuckers quit yawnin. Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in the mornin. So have sing along with the words to the song an.

But so what this beef is like. 'What the fuck did he say in his rap Em?'. I can see that he's just a punk. I mean these niggaz squeeze on me. Please I'm seeing guts. I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks. Am I empty seein them white I emtpy out them white to fight you. In front of every reporter that I don't like. No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write. So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"". I might as well give this up like heavy sales. And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt. We can't self destruct. I've never felt it this much. Come on fellas, get up. We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life. [Verse 4: Kuniva]. I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off-a the hip. I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith. Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick. We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit. You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's. But the only thing you shoot is the breeze. I can't believe you speaking on movin key's. But every time we hear you kick it. The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets. I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack. So when they bust you better bust back. And get your guts clapped outa your stomach. And when they want it (yeah). I bring a hundred niggas from runave. So get your gun and if you comin. [Chorus: Eminem]. Come on an everybody come on an.

Won't find another one to ride it. Like a soldier like this. Regret in your tears, now you taste 'em. 'cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em. Don't rush, take time, take some. I just want the memories. Tried to make some with you. You. Now I gotta erase some with you. You. Yeah, and they say big girls don't cry. Maybe I cried. The real ones don't lie. Baby you lied. I don't know what to do with you. Baby now I'm through with you. 'cause you don't even know. What you just lost. You don't even know what you just had. You don't even know, and that's what's bad. Money bag long, that bitch bad. Used to lay up in them sheets. They were snow white. Now you spendin' cold nights. You've been in the wrong so long. You don't even know right. Call my line, call my line. I'm like, ""please, boy"". You just need to leave, boy. I ain't got time for you. Just once, do somethin' for me, boy. Regret in your tears, now you taste 'em. 'cause you know I don't chase. I replace 'em. Don't rush, take time, take some. I just want the memories. Tried to make some with you. You. Now I gotta erase some with you. You.

"Turn the track up a little bit. We need to rock in here. I wanna make you happy. I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite. It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it. I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence. Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit. I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded. Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest. That's garbage, remember when we loved each other. Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'. Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever. Time went so fast, we had a blast together. Laughs we had, friends we spent time with. Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded. How we all used to gather up for the holidays. Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid. I was your bestie, how it get to this. As I reminisce, takin' off my Mjs in my empty crib. Mary. I wanna make you happy. But you just don't see it. I wanna be around, babe. But I'm so tired of competing. We say all the wrong things. Till we make each other cry. What are we doing?. Will it ever get better?. My heart, my soul. I gave, it's yours. I can't get back. All the things that I lost. Boy, I love you. But you're pushing me away. I gave you everything that I got. Watched my feelings walk on by. Ever get sick of trying?. This is how I feel inside. Now I was hoping. We'd get through this together. You said you'd love me. Through all types of stormy weather. Wasn't it you who said. We'd be together for all time. But it keeps messing with my mind. My heart, my soul. I gave, it's yours. I can't get back. All the things that I lost. I need you here near me. But I can't make you stay. I gave you everything that I got. Watched my feelings walk on by. Ever get sick of trying?. This is how I feel inside. I never thought that I would have this feeling. Do you think for once that you can truly mean it. Wasting so much time disagreeing. See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in. If you don't want this, I don't want this. I do my morning crunches. Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset. Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night. Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back. Tell me why it's like that. So make up your mind, boy decide. We can't go on like this, this ain't right. (it ain't right). Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low. Think it's time to go. I gave you everything that I got. Watched my feelings walk on by. Ever get sick of trying?. This is how I feel inside",Hip Hop,Mary J. Blige

On bended your knee again,. No running from the truth as much as we pretend,. That it ain't what it is, than it hits Cnn. Apologies to my fans and my closest friends,. For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again. Most of you now saying, ""Whatever, here we go again"". Blogs, radio, and television all going in. I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrasment. I gotta say you f-cking haters is hilarious. How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou. Point your finger now with me looking down. Same clown that was twitpicking at my wedding. On the same twitter page disrespecting, wait a second.

My road to redemption has no gps. So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested. Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight. Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light. The bible say ""let he without sin cast the stone first"" (stone first). The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?. Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs or to be fair. He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead. Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media. Thanks to tmz, the ajc and wikipedia. See the stairway to heaven while stepping down jacob's ladder. My good outweigh the bad, god, aint that what really matters, nope. A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that the good I've done in your hood. Should it overshadow that?. Got the world laughing at me for the moment. But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with. Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence. The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this. Chorus. Push the dirt off your jersey than go for the cup. Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what. Cause when you got the belt and the ring. People with ya poppin bottles, taking pictures look around.

"Ohh Ohh Ohhh Oohhh. Ohh Ohh Ohhh. Yeah. Listen. I'd be a liar if I told you. That I didn't see it comin'. I?d be more of a liar if I said:. Hey, I didn?t want it to be something..

That my heart. is in two different places:. I got you in my life. And I wanna do right. But it's hard to let it go. When my love has two different faces. And I can't break ties. 'cause they both look right.. Someone tell me. What's a man to do. When he?s loving two.. And he don't wanna lie. But he can't tell the truth. What's a man to do. When he?s loving two.. But he can't keep his heart. In two different places. (in two different places). I know you feel it. 'Cause you stayed. There is much more to the story. But I'd be a fool to say. I trust that I'm always gonna love her. You know that you don't wanna hear. How I'm livin' on the edge, baby. So I just say ""YEAH, BABY"". She ain't nothing,. But she is real. But why I take her through it. When I still got love for you,. Big love for you. Even when I'm trippin',. The fact remains that you. Will always be my baby, my baby. But dig the truth,. Baby dig the truth. I can't hide my feelings. Especially when the whole world can see. That my heart. is in two different places:. I got you in my life. And I wanna do right.

And he don't wanna lie. But he can't tell the truth. What's a man to do. When he's loving two.. But he can't keep his heart. In two different places. (not in two different places). I wanna tell you it's over. And that I ain't thinkin' of her. I wanna really mean it. And I want you to see it. That I really try to leave her behind. And I'm tryin' not to make you cry. I wanna tell you. That I ain't playin' games. And I'm dedicated. to receive a change but. When I look in the mirror. It's the same old me. That my heart. is in two different places:. I got you in my life. And I wanna do right. But it's hard to let it go. When my love has two different faces. And I can?t break ties. cause they both look right.. Someone tell me. What's a man to do.

Conversation is senseless you can sense the tension. Start building soon as we enter the ""106 and Park"" building. Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to god if someone so much as even.

While you punching' and tackling' punks. I'm handling' chumps, packing' the pump. That's longer than the elephant's trunk.. On the streets I'm ""the beast"" I'll feast. Upon the weak, so speak ""beef"". I'll shoot you and scream ""Increase the peace!"" (*explosion*). The monster, pistol packing', pushing' niggaz off they ""Hondas"". Stomp ya, get it cracking' yanking' bitches for they Ganja. Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mamma beat me enough. When she was sleeping and stuff. I was stealing the keys to the truck. Shut the fuck up! Before you end up dead in the dump truck. Or in the streets taking a nap bleeding and locked up. You want what? Like ""M Bleak"" with this Heat. If your ten deep, then fuck it'll be ten asleep (*gunshots*). [Proof: Verse 5]. Don't mess with my alasnke, don't tussle with my aspe. Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed. We ferocious, toast don't host us. Approach us, through heat straight from the shoulders. We the soldiers ya the youngster's. Youngsta's among, arn't ya dead in the dumpsta. Say to the monsta head full of drama. You scared of the truama vomit to monsta. (Woof!) I'm back nigga, (Poof!) I reappear. Shoot like (*boom*) you ain't seeing clear. Blackness, carcass, cover with catfish. We merkers with no purpose other than practice. [Bizarre: Verse 6]. There are three things I hate: liars, fakes, and cheaters;. Alcoholics, and sluts, and fuckin wife beaters. I guess that describes my life,. I don't even know whose song this is? (*Obie Trice*). Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip-hop. At my release party in a pink tank top and Reebok's. This ""Ja Rule"" beef im not getting in, i need an R&B singer to sing at my wedding (Say Yeah!). I'll turn your face into a fuckin' meat patty. I'll fuck yo mommy and go fishing with yo granny. I'll shit on you; I'll pee on R. Kelly too,.",Hip Hop,Obie Trice
[Verse 1]. Time on my hands. Sit and think about what I did wrong. As the days turn into nights. Nights back into days I sit alone. There's blood on my hands. Guilty party. Ain't no sense but I'm the one. I'm responsible for this. Sure as the moon shines. Cuz I'm the sun. [Chorus]. What have I done. What have I done. What have I done. What have I done. [Verse 2]. Selfishly. Catered to my own desires. Never once thinking. That breaking rules just cuz I wanted to. Could possibly hurt you. My only concern was me. And now look at you. Look at what my foolishness has turned you into. In the end a monster. But at first a goddess when we first begun. [Chorus]. What have I done. What have I done. What have I done. What have I done. I'm to blame. Love is a privilege. Not a game. Now you're a monster. I'm to blame. Love is a privilege. Not a game. Now you're a monster. [Verse 3]. Oh so lovely. All you wanted was to love me. How did I end up the lonely one. Not hard to love someone. But it's hard to be in love. Knowing that you're killing that person. Oh so lovely. All you wanted was to love me. How did I end up the lonely one. Not hard to love someone. But it's hard to be in love. Knowing that you're killing that person. In the end a monster. But at first a goddess when we first begun. [Chorus]. What have I done. What have I done. What have I done. What have I done. I'm to blame. Love is a privilege. Not a game. Now you're a monster. I'm to blame. Love is a privilege. Not a game. Now you're a monster,Hip Hop,Ne-yo
