Pop,"Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah) Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage? Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)"
Rap,"I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get I do not snort powder, I might take a sip I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death I got a few mil' but not all of them rich What good is the bread if my niggas is broke? What good is first class if my niggas can't sit? That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss They act like two legends cannot coexist But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin' If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane Everything grows, it's destined to change I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came I hope that you scrape every dollar you can I hope you know money won't erase the pain To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions I promise to slap all that hate out your voice"
Pop,"One week in we let the story begin We're going out on our first date But you and me are thrifty So go all-you-can-eat Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour And how your family is doing okay And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat Tell the driver make the radio play And now I'm singing like Girl, you know I want your love Your love was handmade for somebody like me Come on now, follow my lead I may be crazy, don't mind me Say: ""Boy, let's not talk too much Grab on my waist and put that body on me"" Come on now, follow my lead Come, come on now, follow my lead"
Rap,"Cole World, Cole Life, Cold Blooded I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me How that feel? very happy! I got what you need right here I got what you need right here I got what you need right here I got what you need right here Uh, turn up the 808's for me Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me Now I do it big and that's my day to day story I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry Bitch, I made this in the crib, watchin' Belly Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew See, when you're spittin' so real Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal Got em' feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell At times I watch the news and see they talkin' bout diplomacy And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be I think they scared of me, and they should be"
Pop,"I'm not just trying to get you back on me Cause I'm missing more than just your body Is it too late now to say sorry? Yeah I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? I'm sorry, yeah Sorry, oh Sorry Yeah I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now? I'm sorry, yeah Sorry, oh Sorry Yeah I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"
Rap,"Two bad bitches and we kissing in the wraith Kiss-kissing in the wraith, kiss-kissing in the wraith I need that black card and a code to the safe Code to the safe, code-code to the safe I show 'em how to network, fuck that Netflix and chill What's your net-net-net worth Cause I want ya, and I need ya And I'm down for you always And I'm down for you always And I'm down for you always D-d-down for you always D-d-down for you always I got a new boy, and that nigga trap! Kiki, do you love me Are you riding, say you'll never ever leave From beside me, 'cause I want you, and I need you And I'm down for you always KB, do you love me Are you riding say you'll never ever leave From beside me, 'cause I want you, and I- Bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back B-bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit But, shawty, I'ma hit it, hit it like I can't miss Clap that ass, you're the only one I love, clap that ass Bring that ass back You're the only one I love, let's go, let's go, lets go"
